Removed reclimits on all units except Forsaken
Added recpoints for units (they're all multiples of 3, because why not?)
Check immortality command - done.
Mapmove convert - done.
Also look at iron armor/weapons - done.

Llama's new Tomb Kings and Vampire Counts are in!
Fixed bugs in Vampire Counts as reported on the forums
Added domunrest 2 to VC because Llama definitely wants domunrest but forgot to add it.
2 is a placeholder, seems reasonable but we'll see.
Also fixed some miscellaneous bugs.


VERSION .72 (.71 was Slaanesh changes)
Nurgle's diseaseres completely redone. Most humans now have some disease vulnerability, but daemons are immune.
	Previously, some humans were immune, some humans and most daemons had low or no diseaseres.
	UPDATE: Doh. Daemons had no diseaseres because they aren't affected by disease. Re-removed it.
Nurgle and Tzeentch sorcerers autocalced from 125 gold, also removed adept researcher.

VERSION .70 - Still JoanSam
Lots more miscellaneous changes...woundfend fixes for orcs and...maybe some wood elves? Set the value to 50,
   since there's no way to know what they wanted. Thought I had already done these a while ago...maybe I lost the version somewhere.
   Yeah, just lots of miscellaneous bug fixes highlighted by the inspector. The errors it shows now should just be new modding commands.
Wood Elf multihero crash should be fixed. The multiheroes were just copystats of other units, 
   so they were deleted and the units themselves are now recruitable and multiheroes.
Updated Dark Elves and High Elves to Deathjester's recent versions.
Slaanesh changes in their own changelog.
Chaos weaponry and armor standardized, condensed to Slaanesh versions where possible. This changes a LOT.
Costs changed for Chaos Warriors (20 -> 30), Chaos Knights (50 -> 60) and Chosen (50 -> 65, Slaanesh 60 cause they have no special abilities.)
Empire full plate removed, replaced with vanilla full plate. Vanilla plate has 2 more enc but is 5 res cheaper.
Skaven Moulder Packmaster now summons 3 rats instead of 9 rats and 3 Maharishi...no idea why that was happening.
Skaven starting army was 60 slaves and 30 clanrats, now 30 and 20 respectively.
Crashes caused by Dark Elf flag and initiate and High Elf flag, archer, and spearman sprites fixed.
Screamers summon spell now summons 9 instead of 10 screamers, they also have non-AP weapons now.
Chaos battleaxe (used by Tzeentch's shieldless Chosen) no longer AP but has 2 attacks, res cost increased by 1.
TK skeletons commented out, normal skellies should be summoned from now on.
Flames of Tzeentch no longer AoE 1, now single target. Flames and Lightning have 20 ammo from 50.
Bite attack removed from Chaos Furies of Tzeentch and Nurgle.


VERSION .62
JoanSam's Slaanesh changes detailed in the relevant section of the .dm
Also removed the 'warhorse hoof' weapon and just replaced them with hooves. Only did 1 more damage anyway.

Courtesy of Zonk:
* All fixed cost pretenders switched to autocalc+0 and #cheapgod20. 
Many will need cost adjustements to account for abilities autocalc can't account for, such as #onebattlespell, but it's a start. Please report any unreasonable costs.
* Pretenders with MR < 18 and morale < 30 raised to that, except for Avatar of Horus who only got MR 14->16 (still fits his description, but less crippling)
* #makemonsterX -> #makemonstersX (so commanders meant to summon allies actually can)
* Skaven #cavenation 2 (will always start in caves in possible, previously it was 1 so 'can start in caves')
* Removed many obsolete or redundant pretenders, commands and comments, Orcs' Warpaint and Shadow King's Stone 'armor' (they did nothing, so waste of slots).
* Enabled pretenders for 
Wood Elves : Irminsul, Nature Dragon, Lord of the Wild, Volla of the Bountiful Forest, Idol of Beasts, Bitch Queen
Sylvania : Fountain of Blood, Vampire Queen, Demilich, Prince of Death, Statue of the Underworld, Master Lich, Dracolich, Raven of 
the Underworld, Linnormr, Bog Mummy, Frost Father, Bitch Queen, Ghost King
Tomb Kings : Master Lich, Demilich, Lich Queen, Prince of Death, Ghost King, Neter of the Underworld, Statue of the Underworld, Sphinx
* Light Wizard Lord: healer 20->2

VERSION .61

(Slaanesh changes in the relevant section of the .dm, this was 1.05 I believe) - JoanSam

Zonk:

NULN & ALTDORF
* Priest MR: Initiate of Sigmar 10->13, Warrior Priest 10->14, Arch Lector 10->15

* Flagellant: mor 30->20 (30 means they completely ignore morale effects even when not berserk, which seems excessive)

* Arch Lector MR 10->15 (+1 over Warrior Priest)

* Jade Wizard healer 20->2 & springpower 1->10, Jade Wizard Lord healer 60->5 & springpower 50->25 (healer was % to heal troops in province in Dom3, springpower is a negative -% HP in fall so more isn't always better)

* Removed obsolete lines in .dm referencing Dom3 forts

* Extra blank lines in #summary so it formats properly.

* Altdorf can now recruit the correct units

? Warrior Priest has two costs (100 in recruited form, 80 in tranformed). Inteded, to have a lower upkeep, or to give lower upkeep, or mistake?

? Moot Militia: Uses Short Bows, size 1 units usually use Small Bows instead. This would be a huge nerf however (damage 9->6, range 30->20, ammo 12->8) and make them nearly useless.

? The stronger forestshape of Amber Wizards does not have separate Altdorf & Nuln versions, and so always turns back to the Nuln one. This can be fixed by creating a new unit, or we can accept the 10 gold difference and save an unit ID.


VERSION .60 -JoanSam
Slaanesh changes in changelog
Orcs - Added Face of Mork - same sprite as Face of Gork, but now Morka doesn't have to worship Gork.
