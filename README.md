This project currently has 12 nations:

* High Elves 
* 3 Empire nations 
* Skaven
* Lizardmen
* Ogre Kingdoms
* Chaos Dwarfs
* Slaanesh, Nurgle, and Tzeentch Chaos factions

It's compatible with DomEnhanced and should be compatible with small mods. Other large modpacks have not been tested, but you can use Domingler for custom games, although it does take a bit of work and you have to install the Rust compiler: https://github.com/djmcgill/domingler
When running this mod with DomEnhanced or other mods, load this LAST.
