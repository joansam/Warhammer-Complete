This is the main readme for Warhammer-Complete.
This project currently has 10 nations: High Elves, 3 Empire nations, Skaven, Lizardmen, Ogre Kingdoms, Chaos Dwarfs, and the Slaanesh, Nurgle, and Tzeentch Chaos factions.
It's compatible with DomEnhanced and should be compatible with small mods. Other large modpacks have not been tested, but you can use Domingler for custom games, although it does take a bit of work and you have to install the Rust compiler: https://github.com/djmcgill/domingler
When running this mod with DomEnhanced or other mods, load this LAST.
