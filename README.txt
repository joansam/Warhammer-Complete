This is the main readme for Warhammer-Complete.
This project currently has 12 nations: Tomb Kings, High Elves, 3 Empire nations, Skaven, Lizardmen, Ogre Kingdoms, Chaos Dwarfs, and the Slaanesh, Nurgle, and Tzeentch Chaos factions.
It's not compatible with DomEnhanced but you can run it with the gameplay adjustments of DomEnhanced separate from the DE nations. Other large modpacks have not been tested, but you can use Domingler for custom games, although it does take a bit of work and you have to install the Rust compiler: https://github.com/djmcgill/domingler
When running this mod with DomEnhanced or other mods, load this LAST.
