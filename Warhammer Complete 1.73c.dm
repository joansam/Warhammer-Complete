-- SLAANESH WARHOST

-- VERSION 1.2 - Some Nerfs

-- Fire and shock resistances removed from all daemons, including heroes and pretenders.
--	 Weren't really good reasons to keep them, it was just a straight buff.
-- Chaos armor has 21 prot from 18. Rescost 25 from 17. This is to reflect its sprite and its lore - it had the stats of mail, not plate.
-- Chaos armor forgeable item is now in blood and costs 5 slaves. Findable and un-cursed, like other Chaos items now.
-- Witstealer sword not AP, 4 attacks from 3. Increased att to 3 from 2. Made more expensive, paths now blood and death.
-- Daemon princess random changed from WSD to SD.
-- Avatar of Slaanesh daemon form had Blood 2, changed to B1 and autocosted +50.
-- Avatar forms poisonres +5 to match coldres. Also no longer lifeless - they're alive, just magically.
-- Azazel had a Divine Blessing start of battle spell, removed it - he has H3 anyway. Minor leadership change.
-- Chaos Champ and Exalted Champ costs -10.
-- Health of sorc line decreased to be more human-like.
-- Icon of Slaanesh made unforgeable.
-- Chaos warrior description fix.
-- Chaos fury summon spell name change, summons 7 instead of 8.
-- Chosen w/flail cost fix, should've been 60 but was 70.
-- Minor chaosrec changes, knight cost +10


--VERSION 1.15 - Fucking with balance

-- Chaos Fury size 2 -> 1, cause they look like size 1, and imps are. Prot 6 -> 4.
-- Keeper of Secrets and Daemon Princess spells 1 research level later, Keeper of Secrets 3rd misc slot removed.
-- Marauders buffed slightly: cost 11 -> 10, attack skill 10 -> 11, MR 11 -> 12. Marauder horseman cost 25 -> 20 and increased MR.
-- Bray Shaman has leadership 10 instead of 40.
-- Slaanbull has 80 leadership and no Awe. Health 30 -> 40.
-- Ungor raider (archer) given a dagger, previously had useless kick
-- Removed ambidextrous from Daemon Avatar pretender, she doesn't have hand slots. Changed nametype to new Daemonic.
-- Decreased Daemonette and Seeker defense by 1
-- Champion cost 45 -> 75, Exalted Champ 55 -> 100, Chosen cost 70 -> 60, Chaos Warrior 35 -> 30, Standard Bearer 45 -> 40, Chaos Knight 60 -> 50
-- Gave exalted champ +20 leadership and a helmet.
-- Removed inquisitor from Herald and Cultist, potentially too powerful.
-- Adjusted summon costs for Daemonettes, Seekers and Fiends slightly upward, especially Fiends - they were underpriced.
-- Fiend health 25 -> 20, description changed to reflect their awesome offensive power.
-- Exalted sorc description fix
-- Decreased cost of sorc and exalted sorc by 5...apparently something is putting them 5 over the value shown in the inspector.
-- Increased base rescost of mounted marauder to 6 and knight to 20, as per vanilla standards.
-- Daemon-forged blade no longer AP, 3 attacks instead of 2, and no longer intrinsic. Silverslash back to AP and 3 attacks.


-- VERSION 1.10 (Cause I can do whatever I want with these numbers)

-- New, improved sprites for Sigvald's Chosen, Chosen w/sword, Seeker, and Sorcerer!
-- Name changes, including all-new names for Daemons!
	-- They were just random mishmashes of evil-sounding words ("Lovehate" and "Skinjob", anyone?) so I replaced them.
	-- In place of the 99 old names, we have 161 names from online lists of Chaos daemons! Say hi to Tkk'arr'quoth and Vha'shaelhur!
	-- Minor name changes of some humans to their tabletop names: 'Warrior of Slaaanesh' to 'Chaos Warrior' and so on.
	-- Description changes to sorcerer line.
-- Human rebalancing:
	-- Increased Chosen cost to 70 gold and Warrior to 35, decreased their health by 4 (was 20 and 18, now 16 and 14). HP changes also apply to knight, standard bearer.
	-- Increased MR of most human units by 1, as 12 seemed rather low for Chaos Warriors, who live in the most magical area on their earth. Forsaken MR +2.
	-- Increased human morale by 2, to simulate the Mark of Slaanesh: "Immune to Psychology" effect.
	-- Gave Chaos Champion Holy 1 and Chaos Lord B1 Holy 2, so that leading Chosen isn't a huge pain. Also made cultists poor leaders (10 guys).
	-- Fixed Exalted Champ's leadership - had 20 for some reason, now has 40. +autocost, minor stat increases and benefits from Daemonic whip.
	-- Removed mountain survival for like...all human units. Isn't actually thematic, and Chaos should have slow movement.
	-- Removed reclimit for foreignrec marauders. In the process, eliminated 2 gratuitous unit IDs.
	-- Increased knight cost from 50 to 60, base defense from 12 to 13.
	-- Messed with Chaos Broadsword, Hammer, and Morningstar. They have 2 attacks and I think the sword is better, so:
	-- Rescosts of 7 for sword, 6 for morningstar, 4 for hammer. Decreased hammer damage from 8 to vanilla 7.
	-- Chaos Armor - Increased defense penalty and encumbrance from 1 to 2, and resource cost to 17, as Full Chain costs 17 and gives 3 enc and def penalty. Maybe Prot will be buffed slightly in future.
	-- Sorcerer not sacred any more - wasn't really justified. Decreased autocalc cost by 5, he's 65 gold now.
	-- Gave Chosen 2 enc (was 1, but they're human, not Daemonic).
	-- Added appropriate Chaosrec to the sorcerer lineup, previously they were left out.
	-- Removed slowrec from Chaos lord
	-- Standard bearer now has chaos sword instead of normal one.
	-- Made cultist stealth 60 instead of 50
-- Beastmen rework:
	-- Gave most beastmen the 'furs' armor, like Pangaean creatures have. Previously many had no armor. Also decreased cost to 9 for ungor and 10 for gor.
	-- Removed Slaangor and Minotaur from recruitment pool. Neither of them looks very good...the minotaur is worse but the slaangor is the wrong sprite for its unit...too small and with a sword and shield, not an axe.
	-- Slaanbull: 30 -> 45 HP, Size 3 -> 4, +15 gold.
	-- Removed Awe from Wargor, he shouldn't have it. Also set him to autocost.
	-- Removed reclimit from ungor raider - unnecessary.
	-- Ungor raider halfhorn now leader of 40, not 10.
	-- Bray-shaman's random changed from NS to NSD, made sacred.
-- Hero rework:
	-- Properly updated Sigvald - he's now much more in line with the other Daemons. And he's a B3 H3 priest, due to his religious importance. Silverlash now has 4 attacks but is not AP.
	-- Dechala the Denied One now has D3B2H2, so she's somewhat useful. Resistances reworked, def and prot buffed in accordance with lore and added recuperation.
	-- Azazel now more Daemon-y - has hp regen, recup, resistances, etc. Magic now A3W3, B3H3, with an 100% AW random. Sword has 3 attacks, from 1. A little bit less HP and magicpower 2.
	-- Styrkaar improved - given W2A1B3H3 instead of just W1A1. Also recup and magicpower. Description improved a lot but still not great.
	-- Chosen Chaos Lord multihero (and prophetshape of Chaos Lord, I now realize) now has B2H3 and buffed stats in accordance with old human hero changes.
-- Assorted other changes below:

-- Removed Aura of Slaanesh from Daemonette, Seeker, and Fiend. It also now doesn't affect friendlies or mindless. Was a bit too powerful on the weakest Daemons.
-- Also, the whole Aura was borked - was paralyzing enemies, not doing stun damage. Fixed.
-- Resistances - finished, heroes included - but not completely sure they'll stay this way. The powerful daemons now have a ton.
-- Tinkered with MR on Daemons - 1 pt higher for Daemonette and Herald, 2 pts lower for Avatar and 1 for Keeper of Secrets.
-- Keeper of Secrets Death 3 -> 2, although still has a random +3 with chance of death.
-- Removed warhorse hoof attack from knight, just gave him the vanilla hoof. Not actually worth it, knights and everyone in vanilla have normal hooves.
-- Fixed bug - Chaos Vortex now yields correct gems.
-- Removed bite attack from Chaos Fury - 2 attacks are quite enough for a tiny little imp-thing.
-- Standard bearer now has a helmet, like his sprite and the other chaos warriors.
-- Increased Daemonic whip rescost, gave it 2 attacks.


-- VERSION 1.05
-- Battlefield magic changes - reworked spell "Acquiescence". 20+5/lvl AN dmg, MR neg, friendlies only, range 25+ and AoE 5+. W2, Evo 5. Slicing Shards and Phantasmagoria removed so as not to give lots of unique battlemagic.
                             -- added spell "Bliss in Torment" - basically Celestial Music for Slaanesh's daemons.
-- Sorc given W1 instead of WAF random, Sorc Lord now has W4 and a +3 A/F random. Cost discounts for Sorc Lord, Exalted Sorc for being priest mages.
-- Daemon resistances standardized - as they are made of Chaos energy, resistant to all elements. Base prot decreased by 2 for all daemons.
-- Assorted minor stat changes - removed fear from daemon princess, removed stealthy from daemonettes, added recup to exalted daemon, etc.
-- Avatars of Slaanesh cost changed - Daemon avatar is 350 points, human avatar is 130.
-- Nation description changed - less lore, more clarity about what it actually is.
-- Blood summons recosted, non-commanders a bit more numerous to make it less annoying to get lots of them.


-- VERSION 1.04 - Yes, I skipped a bit. This is a big update, and 1.05 will be nice for the more definitive version.

-- New sprite - Eziky's cultist instead of the old one! It's much cooler - she's got a fun color scheme and interesting robes. Also cultists now have inquisitor - cause they go corrupt enemy lands.
-- Increased HP of chaos warriors, chosen, and human commanders, along with morale and 1 strength. HP because in tabletop they have a lot more than humans, and morale because gift of Slaanesh is immune to Psychology, and the best way that translates in Dominions is higher morale.
-- Chaos warriors 20 -> 30 gold, because stat increases.
-- Added weapon, Chaos Warhammer - ID 1862, to achieve parity of Chaos Warriors. Previously only the sword one had 2 attacks. Chaos weapon theme is +att and -def from normal weapon version.
-- Removed awe from Chosen, decreased cost of all Chaos chosen to 50g (Khorne's are already.)
-- Reworked intrinsic daemonic weapons (scythetalons, tentacles, and claws), now they make sense. All have 2 attacks, claws and tentacles are AP and for the better daemons.
-- Changed name of Daemonette to "Daemonette of Slaanesh" for consistency.
-- Widespread revamp of summons - changed flavor, changed stats to intended - more elemental resistances and more diverse stats.
-- Added lance to Chaos Knight, changed his broadsword to a chaos broadsword (2 attacks).


--VERSION 1.01 - JoanSam

-- Changed sorc cost to 90 gold (from 60), sacred and +2 adept researcher. Added a flav phrase.
-- Chosen reclimit removed - they're not that powerful compared to other WH faction sacreds.
-- Daemon tentacle, Slaaneshi claws, Scythetalon all intrinsic weapons, Aura of Slaanesh #natural in case flaming/death weapons would affect it.
-- Keeper of Secrets no longer wearing Light Chaos armor (not in sprite, also he has good base prot)

--VERSION 1.00 - JoanSam

-- Magic changes overview:
-- Blood magic scales with priest level, to make explicit the connection between Daemons/Gifts and worship.
-- Human magic focuses on Water, Air, Fire, in no order.
-- Daemon magic focuses on Water, Death, Astral, in that order - the daemons are closer to 'true' magic.
-- Exalted Champion and Lord no longer have magic
-- Custom blessings removed; they were a silly workaround. Sorcerers and daemons now have priest levels.
-- Reintroduced cultist as B1H1, removed sorc's B1H1 and gave them S1 for ease of micro. Added flavor text.


-- New unit: Exalted Daemon, with other Slaanesh mod Chaos Lord sprite and, new summon spell.

-- The Exalted Daemon is a priest lvl 2 with inquisitor and stealthy. She has some minor magic, and can summon 1 Daemonette/turn.
-- Cultist removed for now (in unit and in rec list), could add later if necessary. Should give them blood if they come back in though.
-- Lots of description changes
-- Most commanders moved to autocost
-- Champion, Exalted Champion, Lord no longer have the magic item Chaos Armor, they now have the equipment. Actually, since it's magic armor you might want to do something about it.
-- Scythetalons no longer AP but have 2 attacks, debatable though.
-- Aura of Slaanesh was broken, now does 33 stun damage instead of 5. Also now AoE1; it's an Aura in WH, not actually a weapon.
-- Daemon-Forged broadswords and morningstars used by Chosen and Champions are now much more in line with WH stats. They have 2 attacks, and are not magic or AP. They are now named Chaos broadsword and morningstar. All units have been updated accordingly.
-- Chaos Armor prot 17 -> 18, def penalty 2 -> 1.
-- Sigvald the Magnificent: His sword, Sliverslash, now gets 6 attacks, from 2. Awe 3 -> 6. Added base prot 15 - otherwise headshots are brutal. No longer immortal.
-- Sprite of Herald changed to Amazonian Chosen - used for Exalted Champion in the other Slaanesh mod. Also changed stealth 20 -> 60, added inquisitor tag (is priest 2). Can summon dameonettes.
-- All summon spells changed from Conjuration to Blood, path req often lowered by 1, pathreqs trimmed and number of 'gems' required multiplied by 3 for blood slaves(standard stuff).
-- Added an extra attack to fiends, fiends now summon 4 instead of 2...seemed underpowered
-- Keeper of Secrets hugely improved - all-around better stats, gifted with high Awe, regen, recup, and has 1d6 fiends in battle, among more typical changes.
-- Items and armors changed to appropriate paths


-- Below changes are Sensori's.

-- Version 0.93 - Warriors of Slaanesh had the str of Warriors of Nurgle. Second Chosen of Slaanesh had reclimit 3. Pretender prices now autocalced and 20 off their prices. Added #natural to Chaos steed hoof, Slaaneshi claw and Scythetalon.

-- Version 0.92 - Sombre made the Keeper of Secrets attack sprite a new mouth! reclimits on Chosen make a comeback, Lords became StR (also increased research malus on Champs, Exalteds and Lords). Lowered research bonuses on Sorcerers by 1, higher ups lost theirs entirely (autocalc decides Exalted Sorcs price now). Lowest Sorcerer lost his leading ability. Exalted Champs and Lords lost their ability to instabless their followers. Champions become Exalted, Exalteds become Lords and Lords become Chosen Lords when propheted. Lowered #xpshape thresholds. Added a cultist event. Human followers now use 115 for nametypes.
-- Version 0.91 - Slightly adjusted Light Chaos Armor's rcost and prot down. blunt to Chaos steed hoof. Removed Slaanesh Plate Armor for simplicity's sake (and since Warriors etc. have Chaos Armor in tabletop). Increased Sorcerers' AP to 12, since that's human norm. Changes to #chaosrecs here and there. Champion lacked #chaosrec altogether. Added sounds to some weapons. Added Aura of Slaanesh to both Seekers of Slaanesh and Fiends of Slaanesh, removed one Scythetalon from the Seekers of Slaanesh (Fiend is now #awe 2, too).

-- Version 0.90 - Chaos steed hoof to 15 dmg and 1 att. Marauder Horsemen and Chieftains to 24 AP. Sorcerer became considerably cheaper while Exalted Sorc and Sorc Lord (who also became a poorleader) became more expensive (went overboard with the price reduction! Indract's autocalc stuff made me realize the pricing wasn't even close to right; and the research bonus on the Exalted and Lord were too high anyway, so I got a bit of a price reduction from there). Massive changes to Daemon command structure. Hammer Warriors had 11 att/def, 12 was what they were supposed to have (thanks Indract!). Daemon Princess had her #coldres upped to 5. Slaanesh's Plate Armor had -2 def, it was supposed to have -1 def (which Tzeentch's Plate Armor was enjoying), oops! To combat ridiculous morale bonuses from commanders, used #command where applicable and dropped #inspirational here and there. Gave the same higher Beastmen Slaanesh's gimmick as Nurgle's and Tzeentch's Beastmen have. Removed dt_cap from the Exalted Champ's whip.
-- Adjusted Slaanesh Plate Armor's #rcost down and adjusted Warriors' #chaosrec to be 1. Removed #seduce from Champion. Slight increase to Lords' AP. Chosen Lord received slightly more AP and a 66% chance for extra magic. Standard Bearer's #standard reduced to 1, cost reduced to 20 and #chaosrec to 1. Bray-Shaman had less MR than it was supposed to (thanks Indract!). Forgotten to add itemized Chaos Armor to Forsaken Champ. Ungor Raider Halfhorn's price dropped to 35. One of the Marauders had 0 prec (a mistake that came with the CU background, thanks Indract!). Champion's base enc was 3, reduced to 1. Marauder Horseman and Chaos Knights had 5 enc, dropped to 4. Acquiescence was now too powerful, another attempt to adjust it (this time it causes a small amount of Weakness (MR negates) and Paralyzation (MR negates)). Made Lord 285gp.

-- Version 0.85 - Added W based versions of blessings to match the other warhosts. Acquiescence was doing nothing, now it should function properly. Noticed that Slaangor had Tzaangor in its description, as well as the wrong weapon stated in it. Upped Chosen Lord's and Styrkaar's MR to Lord of Slaanesh's level. Foreignrec Cultist can now sail. #undcommand 5 to Chieftain. Added Icon of Slaanesh, which gives Cultists one extra point of holy (#restricteditem was fixed!). Added a new spell, Banquet of Slaanesh, which is basically a Slaaneshi version of the Nurgle spell, Consecration of Nurgle. Lowered Daemonettes to research level 3. Warriors are now 20gp. Lower prices on Sorcerers, removed their magic/undead leadership, lowered regular leaderships, gave a research bonus. Removed lots of autocalced prices to keep them what I want with changes. Removed Forest Survivals from most mortal followers of Slaanesh to accomodate for massive cost changes to Beastmen (also removed StR). Removed secondary paths from the
-- freshly added Blessings which were stopping people with just W from casting them! Inept researcher to Champs, Exalted Champs and Lords. Changes to Spawn of Slaanesh (became more similar to other Spawns, also changed #fear to more national #awe). Slight edits to #summary. Small typo fixes here and there. Made #foreignrec Marauders #coldrec. Reclimits on Chosen uplifted (Sacred is enough limit). Itemized Chaos Armor given to all commanders that had it. Champs and Exalted Champs now have #xpshape. Changed Sorc Lord Pretender's slots. Added a morale bonus to Chaos Armor. Sigvald received his own elite bodyguards as #batstartsum. Removed magical leadership from everything.


-- Version 0.75 - First release of the mod. Using freshly made assets as well as altered Tzeentch/Nurgle warhost assets and a slightly altered sprite from Chaos Undivided by Sombre (the Keeper of Secrets, shading and nicer differences in the attack sprite) and the usual altered Chaos Undivided .dm. Built Dechala on the Dechala for Chaos Undivided that Noble713 (from the Shrapnel forums) made. Starting at such a high version due to it not being likely that I would release 100 releases... Not that it's likely there will be 25, either, but it sounds nicer, and is more in line with the other mods.

The Fiends sing to one another as they run, emanating a high-pitched and pervasive chitter that few mortals consciously hear. Though a Fiend is perhaps frailer than other Daemons of their size, their razor-sharp talons eviscerate mortal foes before they have the chance to react."

Either way, Slaanesh grants a mortal host the gift of possession by a powerful daemon, which mutates the host's body to serve its ends. These daemons must constantly exert their will to remain inside the mortal form, and are thus not quite as powerful as Daemon Princes. However, they delight in combat just as much as their brethren, and their magic is still powerful by the standard of most mortal spellcasters."

Formed of the stuff of Chaos, Slaanesh has granted these servants his greatest gifts and protected them from enemy magic almost as well as from mortal weapons. Those few brave mortals who face up to such a monster must be pure of heart and mind, for a Keeper of Secrets is surrounded by many enchantments that lull the mind and deaden the senses. It can invade the thoughts and senses of its enemies, penetrating their every psychic defence - sending them false visions of glory, stroking their egos and their innermost desires to lead the fools astray."

It is then that the caster assails the village in earnest with the aid of the Daemonettes, killing and feasting upon the flesh of the innocent and guilty alike. Once the village has been brought to the ground, the caster finds himself less human; he craves mortal flesh, his soul corrupted but his body healed of afflictions.

#brief "Barbarous Northmen, mutated by Slaanesh into fearsome superhuman warriors, and mighty summoned Daemons with Magic Power."
#descr "Slaanesh. The Chaos God of Pleasure, Passion, and Decadence. His cults flourish within the lands of Men; his principle of indulging in every vice easily makes him the most popular of the Dark Gods within the civilized lands. His warriors, loyal servants all, yearn to ascend to Daemonhood with his favor. His Daemons possess all manner of Gifts; mortals find themselves unable to harm such splendor, and often fall into a stupor before it. Daemons depend on the winds of magic to manifest physically in this world, and their power will vary accordingly."
#summary "Race: Brutal Chaos Warriors, Beastmen and Daemons. Limited Ocean Sailing. Prefer cold scale +2.
Military: Strong armored melee infantry, forest-recruitable Beastmen, summoned Daemons with Awe and fatigue-causing auras. Many units have multiple attacks.
Magic: Primarily Water, with Air and Fire for human sorcerers and Blood, Death and Astral through Daemons. Some Nature and Death through Beastmen.
Priests: Strong. Cultists start cults in foreign countries by causing unrest in lands with turmoil. Can blood sacrifice."

-- END OF SLAANESH, BEGINNING OF TZEENTCH --

-- Xma: autocalced rpcost, set rp, set mapmove, removed magicboost so you get a prophet, added snowmove and riverpassing to floaters (bugged without ?), corrected spell IDs.

-- Version .7 of WHComplete - Daemon-forged battleaxe renamed Chaos Battleaxe, not a magic weapon.

-- Version 1.01 - Wand of Whimsy was missing a type and apparently went in the Misc slot. Oops! Warhounds now get a more devastating Venomous Bite. Made Pretender gcosts autocalc, also made the national Pretenders 20 cheaper. Added #natural to Chaos Steed hoof and Scythetalon. Lowered combat spell precision to 5 where applicable.

-- Version 1.00 - Version 1.00! How disturbing. --#magicboost 8-7 works now, a lot of clutter removed. Chaos Fury was missing #holy, added. Chosen reclimits made a comeback and the Lord became StR (also increased research malus on Champs, Exalteds and Lords). Lowered research bonuses on Sorcs by 1, the rest lost theirs (autocalc decides Exalted Sorc's price now). Lowest Sorcerer lost his leading ability. Exalted Champs and Lords lost their ability to instabless their followers. Added event s to turn Chosen Lords into Spawns or Daemon Princes. Champions become Exalted, Exalteds become Lords and Lords become Chosen Lords when Propheted. Tzaanbulls now have invuln 15. Lowered #xpshape thresholds. Added a cultist event. Human followers use 115 for nametypes.

-- Version 0.99 - Slight adjustment down on the #prot and #rcost of the Light Chaos Armor. #blunt to Chaos Steed Hoof. Removed Tzeentch Plate Armor for simplicity's sake (and since Warriors etc. wear Chaos Armor in tabletop). Reduced the start numbers of the second Marauder group to 10 to match the other Warhosts. More alterations to Lord of Change's sprite (Sombre made the head!). Apparently copyspelling Blessing caused all kinds of issues with the Blessing item on the Cultist, seems to work now that it's no longer a copyspell (also, the Cultist became Sacred; same as every other Cultist). Removed the Discord of Tzeentch (Banishment) item, as you can only have one restricteditem per Commander and that slot is already taken by another item. Screamers are now #stormimmune. Cyspeth's onebattlespell is no longer wasted on summoning 2 commander cronies, and instead uses #batstartsum2 (since it seems to work properly now on ranged, which means spell slot 180 is now open). Lord of Tzeentch's magical abilities
-- were changed to stop unboosted teleporting/cloud trapezing. Gave Minotaurs/Tzaanbulls 2 more invuln. Changes to #chaosrecs of many things. Obelisk lost its magic but gained the Cultist's blessing item (still spreads dom) and became capable of using the Greater Blessing item, too.

-- Version 0.98 - Chaos steed hoof to 15 dmg and 1 att. Marauder Horsemen and Chieftains to 24 AP. Sorcerers became considerably cheaper, while Exalted Sorcerers and Sorcerer Lords (who became poorleaders, too) became more expensive (I forgot about the massive boon Sacred is! Thanks Indract for reminding me! Made the price hike a bit less steep by halving researchbonus on Exalted and Sorc Lord). Screamers became undisciplined (as suggested by Orionja). Massive reworking of Daemon command structure. Slightly upped Lord of Tzeentch's gcost. Upped Daemon Prince #coldres to 5. Tzeentch's Plate Armor had -1 def, while that was supposed to be with Slaanesh's Plate Armor (which was -2 def, like Nurgle's), oops! Tzeentch's higher Beastmen got their gimmick from #invulnerable 10. To combat massive morale bonuses from commanders, started using #command where applicable and dropped #inspirational here and there. Discs of Tzeentch lost their flying ability (leaving them with #float), but things with them received a
-- boost to AP (upped to 25); this also means I gave the gimmick of Invulnerable 10 given to Beastmen to the human followers, too. Cultists lost S, but received an item they can cast Blessing of Tzeentch with (and there is a 5F gem forgeable item for Discord of Tzeentch), also the Icon of Tzeentch is now just 5S gems. Gave the Flamer and the Changebringer Drake Fire as main mode of attack instead of Flames of Tzeentch, making them less of a copy of the Horrors. Adjusted Warrior's chaosrec to 1. Standard Bearer's standard reduced to 1, gcost down to 20 and chaosrec to 1. Spawn of Tzeentch had enc 3, changed to 1 (thanks Indract!) and gave it a tentacle attack (since Nurgle one has one too with just as awkward tentacle positioning). Made lance the Chaos Knight's first attack. Forsaken Champ lacked itemized Chaos Armor. Changed Forsaken's Pincer to be the #bonus weapon Pincer. Ungor Raider Halfhorn's price dropped to 35. Lowered Tzeentch Chaos Armor's res cost to 23. #nostr off Staff of Change. Chaos Knights
-- and Marauder Horsemen had 5 enc, dropped to 4. Sounds to attack spells.

-- Version 0.97 - Increased #rcost for some higher-end Beastmen and Exalted Champ + Lord of Tzeentch. Aekold Helbrass was supposed to have #inspirational, I had written it wrongly. Also fixed other issues presented by Dominions 4 Mod Editor. Lowered Sorcerer Lord Pretender's #maxage to 10000. Chaos Furies's .tgas were upper case in the files, but lower case in .dm, changed them to match. Foreignrec Cultist can now sail. #undcommand 5 for Chieftain. Added the Icon of Tzeentch, which allows Cultists to battle-cast the highest level bless. Changed Aegis of Orange Fire to not be MR resists easily and lowered research level. Added Sacreds (Chosen became 5gp costlier) and astral Blessings for them, renamed the other blessings to Sorcerous Blessings and removed the highest version of them. Mages are now slightly lower cost, don't have undead/magic leadership, but have a research bonus. Brought back the Banishment copy, since the warhost has potentially too much early-on trouble with undead.
-- Warriors are now 20gp. Pink Horrors down to research level 3. Massive changes to Beastman pricing etc., removal of Forest Survival on human followers of Tzeentch to accomodate for this change. Got rid of lots of autocalced costs to keep them sameish. Removed Galrauch's leadership and changed his E to A. Removed E and W from random magic lists (except E from Sorc Lord), as the nation isn't supposed to have full access to all magic paths (as the nation gets D and N through Bray-Shamans), left E on Vilitch however (as he has been described as lacklustre; E can be his thing). Added an Unstable Chaos Vortex summon which, in turn, summons ten Pink Horrors and then goes away and "turns" into a Herald of Tzeentch (the Vortex causes unrest and kills population). Gave negative #researchbonus to the Champs, Exalted Champs and Lord to denote their status as fighters. Changes to Spawn of Tzeentch (now it's similar to the other Spawns). Slight edits to #summary. Made #foreignrec Marauders #coldrec.
-- Reclimits on Chosen uplifted (Sacred is enough of a reclimit). All commanders with Chaos Armor now start with an itemized Chaos Armor in Chest slot. Added #xpshape to Champs and Exalted Champs. People on discs lost their feet slots again. Dropped magical leadership from everything.


-- Version 0.95 - Removed chest slots from units/commanders with Chaos Armor, because you aren't supposed to replace Chaos Armor (going through #itemslots also means units mounted on Discs of Tzeentch will get leg slots, as there's no reason why you couldn't sit on it while putting boots on); not adding to commanders with Light Chaos Armor. Added a onebattlespell self-bless for some commanders/heroes with Chaos Armor. Altered Vilitch's itemslots a lot. Added armorpiercing to a lot of magical weapons. Lowered Spawn of Tzeentch's (renamed it) prot a little but increased its #invulnerable. Switched the Daemon-forged Battleaxe to use Ulm's Bane of Heresy instead of Halt Sacred, making it even more potent. Warhound received the ability to berserk. Forsaken Champion became a Beastmaster and received #animalawe (due to being the commander in the wastelands with the Warhounds). Changed the long and short nation descriptions (the long un was basically an edited CU one, so, it was boring).

-- Version 0.94 - Changed the Chaos Vortex to Chaos Vortex of Tzeentch. Made the Daemon-forged Battleaxe a bit more potent (Halt Sacred), and as such made the Chosen wielding it a bit more potent. Brought up MRs pretty much across the board (because my "high" was apparently "mediocre"). Max ages to Chosen and Warriors. Added Tzeentch Plate Armor, gave it to several units below Chosen to make Chaos Armor a bit less common. Altered the itemized Chaos Armor to bless its user. 2S for the Daemon Prince. Removed unique tags from Heroes. More morale for Warriors. Made Warhounds #undisciplined (since Forsaken are). Fixed the Greater Blessing of Tzeentch (it had no MR check and wasn't usable underwater). Gave Pretenders a version of the Greater Blessing as onebattlespell. Increased LoC's prot and #invulnerable (also fixed a typo in #invulnerable). Added an extra, middling Blessing type (AOE10 with MR negates). Lowered gem costs of Blessings. Added Obelisk of Tzeentch, which is immobile, has some magic and
-- Version 0.94 - spreads Dominion.

-- Version 0.93 - Changed the armors to have the name "Tzeentch" on them to match the Nurgle warhost. Made the startsites match Nurgle warhost. Slight upgrade to Warhound. Removed Warhound from PD and extra PD adjustments. Raised the MR of the Pretenders to 19, as 18 is apparently the "basic" amount and that won't do! Added a national color. Added armorpiercing to the Daemon-forged Battleaxe, since the Daemon-forged Broad Sword already had it. Altered the costs of the items and fixed Wand of Whimsy's main path.

-- Version 0.92 - Red lining to the icons of the items so it's easier to tell which are mod items. From now on, adding the version number to the .dm file. Added a new Beastman commander, the Ungor Raider Halfhorn, which leads to the Wargor becoming slow to recruit. Added Ungor Raiders, too. Changed Sorcerer Lord's 110 custommagic part to 100 and 10. Apparently 110 is counted as Level +2.

-- Version 0.91 - Added the mod's very first items, starting with a const level 6 Staff of Change which is... A staff meant for fighting. Added a Chaos Armor item, which is basically much like the Chaos Armor all the Warriors and such wear (edited by Neruz from dom4goons!) and slightly upped Chaos Armor's stats. Added a Rune Stone of Sorcery item, which gives 2 temp astral gems in battle. Added Wand of Whimsy, which is a wand that grants the user magical powers. Changes to chaosrecs of Beastmen, so now they cost closer to what the rest cost in high turmoil (reclimits and slowrecs stay the same). Also added #stealthy to many of the Beastmen (all except Tzaanbull and the Minotaurs). Changed the mod's icon a bit.  Added sounds and types to some mod weapons.

-- Version 0.90 - As the mod is pretty much feature complete, I decided to make a massive jump in versions. Less risk of looking like an early alpha this way. One pixel change to the Minotaur's (and Tzaanbull's) first sprite. Changed the Gor's weapon to a Club, as it should've been. There was a typo in the Gor's description. Added Bray Shaman, a mage of the Beastmen, so now they sort of have a full set of recruitables. Adjusted the prices of the mages upwards. Now the Daemon Prince summoning allows for summoning both the Trident type and the Halberd type Daemon Princes! Altered the names and descriptions of the old Chaos Undivided spells; also added a new evocation.

-- Versions 0.01 - 0.12 - The humble beginnings of the Tzeentch Warhost, leading up to MC compatibility and an ever increasing number of units/commanders as well as spells and the like.

Quite atypically, the Tzaangors carry an axe and a shield, while usually Bestigors wield massive, two-handed axes. Bestigors generally form a chieftain's inner circle of retainers and enforcers, but it is in their nature to constantly strive for ever greater dominance amongst their tribes, which can often lead them to challenge the leadership of the tribal chieftain."

Regardless of that fact, it is the horns of a Beastman without which one cannot be considered a real Gor.

The Ungors occupy the lowest station in the warherd; they must fight for whatever scraps of food left over by the others or try and steal them from the tribe's Warhounds. Regardless of their status, however, they are crucial to the warherd, for it is them who have the dexterity to repair and bind the weaponry of their clumsier Gor brethren; without the Ungors, the other Beastmen would find themselves without weapons."

He was physically abusive towards Vilitch for the smallest slight. All Vilitch managed, or was allowed, was to become an apprentice of the tribe shaman, through whom he learnt of the Dark Gods. It was Vilitch's fervent prayers to Tzeentch  for a reversal of their fates that brought forth their fated change; on one Geheimnisnacht, Vilitch and Thomin were fused together. Thomin's intellect had been added to Vilitch's own and he lost his free will, becoming merely a part of Vilitch, and Vilitch's nascent sorcerous abilities were increased a hundred fold. It was then that Vilitch brought vengeance upon his tribe, and by the time the sun had set, the village had been utterly destroyed."

Trailing multi-coloured tendrils in the air, their slashing blades tear through the enemy before they soar skywards once more. Screamers have no real conscious thought, existing merely on instinct and mindlessly hunting along the Winds of Magic for mortal souls. When a Chaos army gathers, they are drawn down from the Realm of Chaos by the pulses of emotion, attracted to battlefields by the carnage and hatred generated. Here they gather in shoals, diving down upon the enemy and feasting on the escaping souls of the slain."

#brief "Barbarous Northmen, mutated by Tzeentch into fearsome superhuman warriors, and mighty summoned Daemons with Magic Power."
#descr "Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways. The greatest of Chaos Sorcerers bear his Mark, for magic is his plaything. His cults are the most tenacious and secretive of all the Chaos Gods’. But when raw force is required, great Warhosts of Northmen made in His name gather and march upon the southern lands of Men, aided by his unnatural Daemons, their forms changing and twisting into new shapes as the nature of reality shifts around them, sometimes warping mortals who come too close. The winds of magic strengthen or weaken their physical bodies."
#summary "Race: Brutal Chaos Warriors, Beastmen and Daemons. Limited Ocean Sailing. Prefer cold scale +2.
Military: Strong armored melee infantry, forest-recruitable Beastmen, summoned Daemons with magical auras and Invulnerability. Many units have multiple attacks.
Magic: Astral, Fire, Air, Blood. Some Death and Nature through Beastmen.
Priests: None. Instead of normal blessings, uses Astral magic. Cultists start cults in foreign countries by causing unrest in lands with turmoil. Can blood sacrifice."

--END OF TZEENTCH, START OF NURGLE


-- Sensori's changelog below:

-- Version 0.94 -- Standard Bearer's #prot 4 was missing and Bile Troll's Infected Vomit had -7 in range rather than 7 (pointed out by Omnipwn on the forums! Thanks!). Pretender prices are now autocalced and the national ones received #cheapgod20. Added #natural to Chaos steed hoof, Poison Tentacle and Rabid Bite. Lowered Fleshy Abundance's #precision from 20 to 5.

-- Version 0.93 -- With the coming of #diseaseres, the human followers lose their ability to regenerate, also added lower diseaseres to Marauders, Sorcerers, regular commanders etc. reclimits on Chosen made a comeback, Lord became StR (also increased the Champs', Exalteds' and Lords' research malus). Lowered research bonuses on Sorcerers by 1, higher ups lost theirs entirely (Exalted Sorc's price now decided by autocalc). Lowest Sorcerer lost his leading ability. Exalted Champs and Lords lost their ability to instabless their followers (also removed the minibless entirely). Sorcerers are no longer resistant to poison. Champions become Exalted, Exalteds become Lords and Lords become Chosen Lords when Propheted. Lowered #xpshape thresholds. Added a Daemonic incursion event. Human followers use 115 for nametypes.

-- Version 0.92 -- Removed Nurgle Plate Armor for simplicity's sake (and apparently Warriors, in tabletop, always have Chaos Armor). Pestigor's chaosrec is now 3, as with the others. blunt and #slash to the flail/sword. #blunt to Chaos steed hoof. Sombre noticed that Nurgle Standard Bearers were lacking a shield. Increased and decreased #mr, #ap, #def etc. according to how they are in Slaanesh Warhost where applicable. Altered the Warhost's flag. Changed Lord of Nurgle's magic to be either 2D or 2N and gave the Lord a shield (which is situated on the mount, because I wanted the Lord to show better on the sprite... I don't know why I've been debating myself over giving the Lord a shield). Returned #heal to Warriors and Standard Bearers (still waiting for #diseaseres). Added Bile Troll, a new unit (thanks Sombre!). More changes to chaosrecs here and there.

-- Version 0.91 -- Chaos steed hoof to 15 dmg and 1 att. Marauder Horsemen and Chieftains to 24 AP. Lord of Nurgle's AP to 20. Sorcerer became considerably cheaper while Exalted Sorc and Sorc Lord (who became a poorleader) became more expensive (went overboard with the price reduction! Indract's autocalc stuff made me realize the pricing wasn't even close to right; lowered #researchbonus to make the price hike less steep). Massive reworking of Daemon command structure. Daemon Prince's #coldres upped to 5. Apparently Tzaangor (and Slaangor) *now* has #stealthy, so Pestigor got his #stealthy back. To combat ridiculous morale bonuses, started using #command where applicable and dropped #inspirational here and there. Made everything below Chosen have #coldres 3, as with the other Warhosts. Slightly adjusted Nurgle Plate Armor's rcost downwards and adjusted Warriors' chaosrec to be 1. Removed recup and regen from Warriors and the Standard Bearer (Plague Knight only lost regen) since other nations' Warriors
-- don't have their specialties, also lowered poisonres. Had forgotten to add poisoncloud to the Chosen Lord, gave it to him, and he also got a 66% chance to get more magic. Standard Bearer's #standard reduced to 1, weapon changed to Short Sword, cost reduced to 20 and chaosrec changed to 1. Foreignrec Marauders weren't actually recruitable (thanks Indract!). Infection from Warhounds is now #mrnegates. Made lance Plague Knight's first weapon. Poison Tentacle was lacking armorpiercing. Ungor Raider Halfhorn's price dropped to 35. Wargor missed his #okleader after everything became living. One Marauder had #prec 0, raised to 10 (remnant from CU, thanks Indract!). Marauder Horsemen had 5 enc, changed to 4. Lord of Nurgle is now 285gp, same as Lord of Slaanesh.

-- supposed to have it anyway). Mages became cheaper, lost leaderships, gained research bonus. Gave some survivals to some Heroes (while Forest survivals are now mostly gone). Got rid of lots of autocalced gold costs to keep them where I want them to be. Doombulls of Nurgle are now Pestibulls, lost their holy but became not slow to recruit, slightly cheaper and have a disease cloud. Warriors became 5gp cheaper. Removed secondary paths from D blessings because they were making them unusable by actual target audience of D mages (changed their explspr & sounds, too). Plaguebearers' etc. weapon wasn't breaking enemy armor, using #secondaryeffects to try and fix it. Changes to Spawn of Nurgle (it's more similar to other Spawns now, and gained national specialties of increased HP, more STR and deathdisease/diseasecloud). Slight edits to summary. Champs, Exalted Champs and Lords became inept researchers. Slight STR increase to Minotaurs and Pestigors. Made #foreignrec Marauders #coldrec. Bray-Shamans had N
-- removed and F instated in its place. Reclimits on Chosen uplifted (Sacred makes them 10 rec limit at best anyway). Changed Champ's and Exalted Champ's ID slots head for head and added #xpshape to both. Valnir's flail lacked #twohanded (which may be bugged). Added a copy Chaos Armor item and gave all commanders with Chaos Armor that version of the armor item. Changed slots of people on Palanquins. Removed undead from all mortal followers of Nurgle and gave them regeneration 5 instead (Banish etc. are too effective against the supposedly hardy followers of Nurgle). Removed Proctection of Nurgle due to the removal of #undead. Added an STR bonus to Chaos Armor. Changed the Sorcerer Lord to have 3 magic paths. Exalted Champ received #fear 5. Added proper #nametype to Sorcerers. Lowered undead leaderships (while heightening regular leaderships where applicable), removed magical leadership.

-- Version 0.78 - Made everything with #enc 0 except GUOs have #enc 1 or 2 (brings enc to Tzeentch warhost's levels). Protection of Nurgle now requires a gem and 2 levels of Ench research. Standard Bearer now has MM1 like its Tzeentch counterpart. Cultist received start/maxage. Added secondary color to nation colors. Fixed #summary formatting. Tinkered with the long description some more. Added a new spell to Ench, "Consecration of Nurgle", which both removes afflictions (also kills pop and gives your mage a craving for human flesh) and summons Plaguebearers. Slight change to the #summary. Added 'Warhammer' to modname (since Tzeentch warhost has it). Brought the Champion up to Chosen levels and upped the Exalted Champ a little. Lowered the price of the Sorcerer Lord Pretender - it was the same price as the Tzeentch one, which can fly, gets a bit more research and such. Added nofind to items. Fixed the Daemon Prince's tail's positioning. Fixed the positioning of a bunch of sprites
-- (didn't really show in-game, but it bothered me!).

-- Version 0.77 - Removed chest slots from units with Chaos Armor, because you aren't supposed to replace Chaos Armor. Lowered #poisonres to "normal" undead levels on all except Daemons. Herald received a buff to its leading ability and a #batstartsum. #ambidextrous to Plague Drone and Rot Fly. Lowered the Spawn of Nurgle's #prot a little but increased its #invulnerable. Warhound received the ability to berserk. Forsaken Champion became a Beastmaster and received animalawe (due to being the commander in the wastelands with the Warhounds). Gave the nation a new main and brief description (the old ones were... Rather generic).

-- Version 0.76 - Fixed Ku'gath's shadow (it was way too small). Fixed Plaguebearer and Herald of Nurgle sprites (they were 1 pixel too low and had too small shadows). Renamed the Chaos Vortex again, to Chaos Vortex of Nurgle. Added survivals to the Champ, Exalted Champ and Lord (since they were supposed to have matching survivals with the Chosen). Added ages to Chosen and Warriors. Added Nurgle Plate Armor, gave it to several units below Chosen. Altered the itemized Chaos Armor to bless its user (and removed the resistances). Brought up the MRs of the Sorcerers. Made Warhounds #undisciplined (since Forsaken are #undisciplined). Increased morale for units from Warriors to Chosen. More MR to Plague Drones/Rot Flies. Changed some #prots and a lot of #invulnerables. #chaosrec was missing from Lord of Nurgle. Chaos Furies had the wrong path to summon.

-- Version 0.75 - Jump in versions due to "why not?" Ever so slight changes to the Minotaur! Added undisciplined to Rot Fly. Changes to the Warhound (incl. Rabid Bite and reclimit). Foreignrec Cultist added. Changed PD, it was the same way it had been in Dom3 and in Dom4 it looked INCREDIBLY HIGH, also removed Warhound from PD due to weapon change. Removed Pestigor's #stealthy because the Tzaangor isn't stealthy. Gave the nation a national color. Added an item, the Nurgle Chaos Armor. Added Filth Mace and Balesword, which are weapons. Lowered the negative Def and amount of Enc on the Chaos Armor to match the Tzeentch armor, still gives less prot (enc was mostly useless due to everyone using it being undead with no enc anyway, and units generally have less def than their Tzeentch counterparts to begin with). Added holy to Plague Drone/Rot Fly. Added armorpiercing to the Daemonforged Axe and made flails take out 2 def. Put a - between all "Daemon" and "forged" to match Tzeentch warhost.
-- Was supposed to have #dmg in weapon commands, and the mistake lead to pretty much no damage in a lot of custom weapons.

-- Version 0.51 - After some feedback, fixing some silly oversights! Giving 18 MR to the Pretenders due to that being the norm. 2D to the Daemon Prince Pretender. Giving the humans (and Beastmen) who had 10AP 12AP, because that's the norm and Nurgle's effects don't really slow people down. Giving the Chosen with the axe a Daemonforged Axe (it's not supposed to be as good as the Flail one, but not that much worse!). Checking if I can get rid of the range on Protection of Nurgle (also giving it an #explspr). Checking att levels on humans in general (same reason as AP; there's no Rigor Mortis), def levels will stay (or become worse) due to "no pain". Other stuff: Adjusted the prices of the Chosen slightly upwards. Adjusted resource costs of weapons. Gave some spells #sounds and explsprs.

-- Version 0.5 - Initial release of the mod! Utilizes a lot of edited Tzeentch warhost assets (which is not to say that there wouldn't be any new ones) as well as the Dom3 Chaos Undivided's .dm as base.

#name "Pestigor"

#descr "Bestigors of Nurgle, Pestigors are, just as their other Bestigor brethren, the strongest and meanest of the Beastmen footsoldiers. Pestigors are racked with pestilence, disease and malformations but still maintain the morbid vigor of their patron god. Another abnormality that they have is that they often bear only a single horn, which is very uncommon among Beastmen. Regardless, just as the other Bestigors, due to their size and ferocity they carve a privileged position within the warherd, constantly enforcing their superiority upon the Gors and Ungors with random acts of violence. Unlike their brethren who prefer large, two handed axes, Pestigors wield flails and shields. Bestigors generally form a chieftain's inner circle of retainers and enforcers, but it is in their nature to constantly strive for ever greater dominance amongst their tribes, which can often lead them to challenge the leadership of the tribal chieftain."

The base form of the Beastmen, and that possessed by the vast majority of the Gors, is the head and legs of a goat and the upper torso of a man, albeit a particularly hairy and malodorous one, even if as creatures of Chaos, there can be great variance from Beastman to Beastman. Regardless of that fact, it is the horns of a Beastman without which one cannot be considered a real Gor. Indeed, in the society of Beastmen, horns are the ultimate mark of rank and power, and their leaders are always those with the largest and most spectacular sets."

#descr "Ungors are physically weaker than the other Beastmen and their horns, if they have any at all, are less impressive and less numerous. Where the Gors usually have long and spectacular horns as deadly as a sword, Ungors usually, at most, have short prongs or horn buds sprouting from their skulls, which in turn are not recognizable as that of a goat or any other type acknowledged by the Gors. The Ungors occupy the lowest station in the warherd; they must fight for whatever scraps of food left over by the others or try and steal them from the tribe's Warhounds. Regardless of their status, however, they are crucial to the warherd, for it is them who have the dexterity to repair and bind the weaponry of their clumsier Gor brethren; without the Ungors, the other Beastmen would find themselves without weapons."

A palpable miasma of fell sorcery surrounds them, and when their wrath is roused reality itself is distorted and maimed. The roots of trees twist and writhe at their passing, the undergrowth boils with unholy life and repugnant parasites scurry at their feet. And within the brutal and bitter world of the Beastmen, they occupy a unique niche. They need not defend themselves from the other members of their tribes, for none would dare to assault them. Indeed, not even the mightiest Beastlord would harm a Bray-Shaman, for they speak the will of the Dark Gods, and those that defy the gods pay the highest price of all."

While, due to his research, Ku'gath remains relatively unaffected by the shifting balance of power within the Realm of Chaos, but also due to said research he is the most willing of Nurgle's Daemons to enter the mortal realm. It is from mortal beings that he gathers most of his plague reagents. And in his years within the mortal realm, Ku'gath has encountered only one race that has managed to kindle his rage: the Dwarfs. Professionally he hates them due to their inability to succumb to disease. Personally, he is embittered by his defeat at Karaz-a-Karak. Indeed, when Ku'gath manages to prepare his perfect plague, they will be his first test subjects. He rides into combat on a palanquin of Nurgle."

In time, he left his tribe, swearing that he wouldn't return until he had found a way to make the world suffer as he did.  It was this purpose that led Valnir to sail across the Frozen Sea, to travel through the lands of the Kurgans, and finally range far to the north to the Chaos Wastes, where he pledged his soul to Nurgle and became His mighty Champion. Long and terrible was Valnir's service to his god, and horrific indeed was the suffering he inflicted in his master's name; but in the end, he was defeated at the gates of Kislev, as unlikely that might have been, his body carried back to his homeland as was his final wish. Now, he has risen once more. Not truly dead or alive, he is sustained by the daemonic powers of Nurgle."

Desperate for a cure, he called out for help; it was the Dark God Nurgle who answered. Promised the knowledge necessary to cure this particular plague as well as all the other diseases in the world in exchange for a lifetime of service, Festus, in his desperation, agreed. Now, he is the Leechlord of Nurgle, devoid of all compassion, a being with an intimate knowledge of all disease and a desire to experiment. Though his curative powers are greater than ever before, woe betide the fool who crosses the Doctor,  for he is not above force-feeding his latest concoctions to his victims in his quest to bring even more repugnant forms of life into the world."

#descr "A mortal who resists the ravages of Nurgle's Rot for a significant time endures an unusually long incubation period for the nascent Plaguebearer, resulting in a larger, tougher individual known as a Herald of Nurgle, who leads the lesser Plaguebearers to battle. Regardless of that however, they are a testament to the fact that even the hardiest of souls cannot indefinitely defy disease. The Herald spreads Nurgle's Rot on his own volition which kills a small amount of the populace, but also summons one Plaguebearer per month."

While this is not a problem for most of Nurgle's servants, it is, indeed, deadly for most mortals."

#brief "Barbarous Northmen, mutated by Nurgle into fearsome superhuman warriors, and mighty summoned Daemons with Magic Power."
#descr "Nurgle: the Chaos God of Disease, Death, Decay, and Destruction. It is the ultimate irony of those mortals who worship Nurgle that many of them had been infected by diseases spread by their dark patron, leading them to follow Him out of desperation. Indeed, Nurgle has oft been the root cause of their plight, yet they do not see it. Of course, not all of them are like thus as they seek His attention; not all desperation is the result of Nurgle's meddling. Regardless of the reasons of their affiliation with the Great Lord of Decay, however, it is a known fact that, among other things, these followers of Nurgle raise Warhosts to spread these dubious 'gifts' of their Dark God. What matters is the danger a Warhost of Nurgle poses to the land and those who inhabit it. His Daemons are the most feared of all, for if they are allowed to march unimpeded, disease and death will follow. They can be strengthened or weakened by the winds of magic."
#summary "Race: Brutal Chaos Warriors, Beastmen and Daemons. Disease Resistant. Limited Ocean Sailing. Prefer cold scale +2.
Military: Powerful infantry and cavalry, no ranged troops beyond Beastmen, strong magic and summoned Daemons with disease-causing auras. Many units have multiple attacks.
Magic: Death, Nature, Blood. Some Astral through Beastmen.
Priests: Weak. Cultists can start cults in foreign countries by causing unrest in lands with turmoil. Can blood sacrifice."

None know for sure, but it is speculated that Yhetees are a remote offshoot of the Ogre race dating back to the time of the first Great Migration. These ferocious creatures arm themselves with lethal ice clubs formed by turning the natural magic of their freezing breath on simple tree branches. The speed and agility of the Yhetee is almost without rival; they may easily outflank foes, scale sheer surfaces and hurtle through and over rough terrain. Yhetees are constantly surrounded by a chilling aura which tires and weakens their prey, ready for the kill. Yhetees are strongest in cold provinces and do not do well in hot environments."

When they return to the Ogre Kingdoms, Maneaters have been exposed to all manner of diseases, dangers, cultures and experiences and as such are profoundly different from their rather backward kin. Despite this Maneaters are still Ogres at heart and with their newfound skill, equipment and and experience backing their natural physical prowess and taste for violence, the tribes have little choice but to accept them. Tyrants of wealth and power have learned to covet and treasure these 'eccentric' fighters as an utterly fearless elite. This Maneater has primarily been active West of the Ogre Kingdoms, participating in conflicts across Tilea, the Empire, Araby and beyond."

When they return to the Ogre Kingdoms, Maneaters have been exposed to all manner of diseases, dangers, cultures and experiences and as such are profoundly different from their rather backward kin. Despite this Maneaters are still Ogres at heart and with their newfound skill, equipment and and experience backing their natural physical prowess and taste for violence, the tribes have little choice but to accept them. Tyrants of wealth and power have learned to covet and treasure these 'eccentric' fighters as an utterly fearless elite. This Maneater travelled East of the Ogre Kingdoms, slaughtering his way across Grand Cathay, the dense jungles of Ind and the hinterlands of Khuresh before reaching fabled Ippon and adopting some of their superior equipment."

Ownership of a Slave Giant is a great status symbol for a Tyrant and there is little that motivates them more than a report of an unclaimed Giant in their territory. Many are the Tyrants who have perished trying to subdue one of these behemoths, but occasioanlly a particularly powerful Ogre may manage to capture one and brand it with his mark. Slavegiants are goaded into battle with pointed stakes, but usually it doesn't take much goading, as the Giant is all too willing to take out the humiliation of being enslaved on any creature smaller than himself. In battle Slave Giants attack by stomping, whipping their heavy chains about and generally causing utter chaos and carnage."

The only way to become a Tyrant is to defeat the previous Tyrant in a brutal rule free pit fight and devour his entire body. Tyrants are almost always Ogres who have travelled as mercenaries, as this experience and the wargear they accumulate give them a considerable advantage over even the largest and meanest tribal rulers. Whether because of their freebooting past, numerous successful pit fights or simply evolutionary process, Tyrants are surprisingly skilled fighters and this, coupled with their sheer strength and cunning, makes them some of the most dangerous creatures in the known world."

The moment fresh meat or living flesh comes near, it gurgles into activity, its fangs reaching out and grabbing its victim in moments.

---- Skrag the Slaughterer

#newmonster 7846
#spr1 "./Warhammer-Complete/Hero Skrag.tga"
#spr2 "./Warhammer-Complete/Hero Skrag2.tga"
#name "Slaughterer"
#descr "Skrag the Slaughterer was formerly a promising Butcher who made the mistake of cooking his Tyrant's favourite pet gnoblar. For this mistake he was hurled into the Gorger caverns with his hands severed and meatpot chained to his flesh. Incredibly, Skrag emerged two years later at the head of a pack of Gorgers, devoured the Tyrant and slaughtered the entire tribe as an offering to the Maw. Now the Prophet of the Maw, Skrag is an embodiment of hunger and destruction; the meat-pot he drags behind him has become a mobile mawpit into which he tosses severed chunks of butchered foes. Skrag is unable to restrain himself in battle, dismembering enemy after enemy, constantly feeding the meatpot and growing ever more gorged on the Maw's favour. Ever since leaving the caverns, Skrag's mere presence in battle has attracted Gorgers who charge forward to attack their terrified prey. As a Prophet of the Great Maw, Skrag spreads the ravenous dominion of his god and calls the blessings of the maw on the entire army by his mere presence."

#newmonster 7817
#spr1 "./Warhammer-Complete/Hero Golgfag.tga"
#spr2 "./Warhammer-Complete/Hero Golgfag2.tga"
#name "Mercenary Captain"
#descr "Possibly the most successful mercenary of all time and a legend in his profession, Golgfag forged a reputation for Ogres as fearsome killers long before they became a common sight in mercenary armies across the Old World. Though he could be mistaken for a mere Bruiser, Golgfag has been in service for nearly sixty years and has killed for coin on every continent. Over the years Golgfag has amassed a personal fortune and a small armory of magic items, but the canny mercenary keeps them well hidden, preferring to carry only his substantial reputation. The term 'Maneater' was first coined when after a drunken argument a young Golgfag ate his paymaster whole and made off with his coffers."

#name "First Prophet of the Wastes"
#descr "Groth Onefinger was the first ogre to set eyes upon the Great Maw. Considered mad due to his insistence that the Maw was coming, he was both proven correct and severely wounded by its impact. Groth lost his nose, lips, ears and all but one of his digits in the resultant firestorm, but rose from the ashes to become the First Seer of the Great Maw and leader of the savage Mawtribes. Despite his badly damaged body his stature as the first ever Butcher is undisputed and Groth's powerful connection to the fiery wastes left him with a great many fiends bound to him. Groth's presence will attract more ogres from the roaming Mawtribes and spread the dominion of the Maw."

#name "Slavelord"
#descr "Known to the Chaos Dwarfs as Ghrask Dragh, literally 'corpse-slaver', Slavelord Braugh is a legend even amongst his merciless peers. Ogre Slavers aren't uncommon in the Old World, but only one can claim to enslave the dead as well as the living. Some years ago Braugh was imprisoned by a necromancer, but being an Ogre of impressive size and strength he managed to rip the enchanted chains that bound him from the walls. He then proceeded to beat the necromancer to death with them and drag the other prisoners away with him as slaves. Somehow the power of the necromancer was trapped in the chains and when one of the slaves died from exhaustion Braugh was amused to find the corpse still bound by dark magic. Years of close contact with the dark chains has altered Braugh into something not quite living and armed with his terrible Fleshflayer he is a terrifying sight."

With a final convulsion his abdomen splits and his entrails spill out as a maw full of jagged teeth emerges. The Slaughtermaster's mind and all vestiges of his former life are devoured and he becomes a vessel of the Great Maw's endless hunger, a terrifying and near unstoppable eating machine."

#brief "The Ogre Kingdoms are a loose coalition of Ogre tribes which, if they set their rather simple minds to it, might devour the entire world."
#descr "Long ago the Ogres dwelled far to the East of the Old World, seldom roaming beyond their lands bordering Great Cathay. The impact of the Great Maw, a massive entity fallen from the heavens, wiped out half of their kind and forced the rest into a great migration East. Instilled with the endless hunger of the Great Maw, the Ogres swarmed the mountain homes of the Skygiants and overcame them with sheer weight of numbers. Quickly adapting to the environment, the Ogres made the mountains their home, dominated the cowardly Gnoblars and spread out, splintering into dozens of smaller Tyrant ruled Kingdoms. For a time the Ogres warred amongst themselves, only leaving their homes to raid or seek employment as mercenaries. In recent years the hunger of the Maw has once again grown overpowering and the tribes, grown to unheard of size, are slowly uniting under the banner of Overtyrant Greasus Goldtooth."

These stronger, more vicious warriors are normally hand-picked by Warlords or powerful Chiefs to create elite units of Stormvermin. Better equipped than their comrades, Stormvermin on the battlefield are inevitably either safeguarding an important Skaven leader or have been given the task of eliminating their elite opposites amongst enemy ranks, once they have been suitably weakened by slaves, clanrats and various support troops. They are armed with lethal glaives, perfect for cutting down fatigued Armored troops or finishing off larger enemies. They are a little more courageous than Clanrats, but retain the naturally cautious nature of their race."

They are highly proficient at digging tunnels and are often used when sieging enemy fortifications. They wear light but effective Armor under their black robes and have a surprisingly high survival rate for Skaven, due mainly to their ability to pick and choose where and when they will fight. They are armed with both poisoned blades for close combat and also venomous thrown shuriken, making them versatile troops. Their skills, however, come at rather a high price."

So used are they to constant pain and disease that it appears to affect them not at all, indeed it is taken as a sign of their God's blessing and they must be hacked to pieces before they will cease fighting, such is their fanatical zeal.

#descr "Only the most deranged and fanatical worshippers of disease are chosen for the honour of carrying a plague censer. These weapons are heavy flails whose spiked heads are filled with burning warpstone incense. The Censer Bearers are fed a special brew laced with warpstone which further enhances their zeal and physical prowess. In battle Censer bearers charge ahead of the ranks of Plague Monks, reciting the Liturgicus Infecticus at a frenzied pitch. They then charge the enemy and begin swinging their heavy censers, releasing a cloud of poisonous gas which is almost as fatal to the Skaven as it is to their foes. This proves to be little deterrent to these fanatic ratmen who scream prayers of thanks to God even as they die, their lungs filled with blood and pus. With the awakening of God, the Censers have become sacred to all Skaven."

They are utterly loyal to the Council and when they march it is usually on a mission of great importance. It is rumoured that they were secretly bred and presented to the Council by Clan Moulder in order to ensure their seat. It is not known whether the Council Guard were bred to be mute, or whether they take a vow; all that is known is that they are utterly silent and utterly loyal. These extremely unskavenlike traits have only added to their mystique and they are regarded as sacred amongst the ratmen. They are armed identically to Stormvermin and have similar training, though they are even larger and more skilled in battle."

The thrower is far from accurate, but friendly casualties are entirely accepted amongst the Skaven, particularly when most of them are inflicted upon lowly Skavenslaves. If sufficiently damaged, the Warpfire Thrower will erupt into a sizeable ball of flame, immolating those poor souls who stood too close.

Their rats made the perfect carriers; fast, vicious and utterly expendable.

Never willing to rely on the slaves typically held by other clans, Skryre have since added miniature warp generators to power these whirling death dealers. Carried into battle by a team of two Skaven, Doomflayers are capable of holding even elite infantry in place and cutting them to ribbons. Weaker foes will be unable to mount any assault for fear of the blades and they make an excellent shield against incoming missile fire.

#name "Moulder Mutator"
#descr "Twisted by many years of exposure to large amounts of warpstone, Moulder Mutators are disturbing creatures. They spend much of their time searching for suitable creatures and slaves as subjects for their experiments and their ability to find new 'ingredients' is unsurpassed. They are also the generals of Clan Moulder, leading armies and taking to the battlefield to personally inspect the impact of their creations. Their presence instills a great deal of fear and discipline in their minions; even the most powerful Rat Ogres shy away from these vicious Skaven, a clear testament of their great skill at inflicting pain on all living creatures. Moulder Mutators are used to dealing with all manner of hideous creatures and are surprisingly skilled with their deadly 'Creature Killer' polearms."

The Screaming Bell spreads His dominion in much the same fashion as a prophet. Furthermore, the warpstone brazier on the Screaming Bell empowers the Grey Seer making him an even more potent spellcaster and accurate farseer."

Tretch prefers to let others do the fighting for him and is an expert at setting other Skaven at the throats of his foes, but his greatest asset is his impossibly good luck, granted in part by the runed rat ogre skull atop his helm.

#name "Arch Plaguelord"
#descr "Since the end of the Skaven civil war the Arch Plaguelords of Clan Pestilens have occupied a seat on the Council of Thirteen. The original seat won by Nurglitch I in single combat was the seventh and lowest, but in the centuries since then the Arch Plaguelords have clawed their way to the second seat, below only the Arch Warlock and Seerlord of seats one and twelve. The Arch Plaguelord rides into battle atop a fetid pox rat, a Pestilens creation which releases a constant cloud of poisonous vapour. As a living vessel of pure contagion, the Arch Plaguelord is both terrifying to behold and incredibly resilient. Even to approach him enemies must brave a swarm of toxic flies and in his clawed hand he clutches the Bubonic Sceptre, a symbol of power which ravages the body and soul of any being it touches with a thousand corruptions, reducing them to festering sludge in a matter of seconds."

#name "Warp Static"
#descr "Feeding a chunk of raw warpstone into a whirring brass device, the Warlock is moments later engulfed in a blinding cascade of warplightning. Gesturing across the squeaking horde in front of him, he directs a roil of barely suppressed energy over them. The chittering of the Skaven builds to a terrible pitch as their fur stands on end and green arcs of energy play across their ranks. The stench of burning fur fills the air as some skaven simply burst into flames. When struck the warp power crackling around the ratmen will discharge in a violent blast, hopefully as lethal for their foe as it is for the unfortunate Skaven. While this Skryre magic is powerful it is extremely tiring and should only be used on expendable troops or those adequately protected from shock and fire."

They are naturally cunning and vicious, incredibly numerous and capable of surviving in adverse conditions, however they are also cowardly and prone to infighting. Skaven society follows a strict heirarchy; the Council of Thirteen and Grey Seers at the top, Greater and Warlord Clans in the middle and the countless slaves at the bottom."
#descr "The Skaven are a race of malevolent rat-men that inhabit the underground of the Warhammer world. The tunnels of their vast under-empire reach from the steaming jungles of the South Lands to the snow-covered steppes of Kislev, from the Western borders of Estalia and Bretonnia to the lost realms of the Far East. Their capital is the myseterious city of Skavenblight, hidden in the centre of the foul marches lying on the western borders of Tilea. There the mighty Lords of Decay, ruthless rulers of all Skaven, sit in the Council of Thirteen, scheming and planning in preparation for the time when their armies will emerge from their subterranean realm to raze the entire surface world and rule over its ruins. This is the ultimate ambition of the Skaven race, a destiny which is preached by the Grey Seers, who are powerful wizards and prophets of the Horned Rat - the malevolent Skaven deity. Skaven society follows a strict heirarchy; the Council of Thirteen and Grey Seers at the top, the Greater and Warlord Clans in the middle and the countless masses of slaves at the bottom. The fortunes of any individual are a different matter though; no race is so prone to scheming, intrigue and outright betrayal as the Skaven, with each ratlike mind devoted almost entirely to climbing the slippery ladder of power."
#summary "Race: Minor poison resistance, stealthy, mountain survival, good at sieging.
Military: Massed infantry, experimental weapons, virulent plagues, and mutated beasts.
Magic: Varied, includes Death, Astral, Fire, Earth, and Blood.
Priests: Powerful, can perform blood sacrifice.
Special Rules: Can randomly discover warpstone sites, exhaust them, and reopen exhausted warpstone with labs. As with all things Skaven, they may blow up in your face."

Still, Warriors are invaluable as it is they who venture forth to conquer and enslave, feeding the endless hunger of their society for disposable labour.

#descr "The Chaos Dwarfs have created a great many weapons of war, with most being as cruel and dangerous as their makers. The best known of these and most widely used amongst their kind is the blunderbuss, a vicious device capable of belching forth a hail of stone or metal shards. The exact alchemical formula used to create the explosive black tar used to propel this flesh-shredding shrapnel is a closely guarded secret, though the Chaos Dwarfs have been known to sell barrels of it to ogre warbands in exchange for slaves. The blunderbuss is best used against packed formations of lesser enemies, particularly those that lack shields or decent Armor, as it is neither accurate nor long ranged. Unlike the archers of weaker nations, the Chaos Dwarfs entrusted with these weapons are well Armored and capable melee fighters. Chaos Dwarfs are resistant to magic, but not to the extent of their Western cousins."

#descr "The crossbow is a traditional weapon of war for all dwarfs, and the Chaos Dwarfs are no exception in this regard. No matter what hideously destructive devices the Daemonsmiths, metalworkers, or alchemists create in the hellish forges of Zharr Naggrund, none will ever truly replace the crossbow. Much like their cousins to the west the children of Hashut regard the crossbows made by lesser races with contempt, for theirs are of considerably better craftsmanship and can propel heavier bolts just as far. Chaos Dwarf crossbowmen wear slightly lighter Armor than their comrades and favour traditional hats with more fabric and less iron, as they are more likely to have to stand watch over slaves for prolonged periods and as such do make certain concessions to comfort.

They are as keen witted as any of their cousins and completely devoted to service of Hashut, Father of Darkness. The Bull Centaurs are trusted by the Sorcerer caste to remain loyal at all times to Zharr-Naggrund and above the schemes of the many ambitious rivals vying for power. Although they are clearly touched by Hashut none of their number have any magical aptitude and they are thus barred from membership in the Cult and as such are not considered sacred."

Because humans can be manipulated by threatening their comrades and respond more readily to the looming spectre of being tortured or sent to the mines they are particular favoured by traders, scribes, and other civilians who lack the strength or resources to keep greenskins in line. They are also regarded by the Cult of Hashut as making for superior sacrifices in certain rituals. As such it is only truly miserable humans that are sent to die in battle; those that are lame, incapable, or too troublesome to manage.

Being holy warriors of the god of Darkness, Acolytes are expected to be able to fight in near pitch black conditions, for they are tasked with protecting summoning circles during the most dire of the rituals performed by the Cult. The mild sorcerous talent of the Acolytes grants them additional resistance to enemy magics."

Frequently these hapless, ungaingly creatures are fleeing the attentions of tribes of ogres, but unfortunately for them the Dark Lands represent an even more dangerous threat, for the Chaos Dwarfs have many uses for their kind. Though slow and stupid, giants are immensely strong and make invaluable slaves whether toiling in the pits, tearing up trees, or on the field of battle. Slavegiants are goaded into battle, but usually it doesn't take much goading, as the Giant is all too willing to take out the humiliation of being enslaved on any creature smaller than himself. In battle Slave Giants attack by stomping, whipping heavy chains about and generally causing utter chaos and carnage."

#descr "Hobgoblins are a subrace of greenskins closely related to the more widespread orcs and goblins. Though not nearly so strong, tough, or aggressive as orcs, they are larger and stronger than goblins and make better fighters. In terms of mindset they are far closer to goblins than orcs, though arguably even sneakier and less trustworthy. Centuries ago the Chaos Dwarfs faced the largest slave uprising in their history and stood on the brink of defeat at the hands of a massive greenskin force which had taken most of Zharr-Naggrund, but at the last moment the hobgoblins, fearing the cruelty of the Chaos Dwarfs more than the brutality of the orcs, switched sides. Since that time the Hobgoblins have been cast out of greenskin society and, while they have risen from the position of slaves to menial servants, they are almost entirely reliant on the protection of their masters. A naturally sneaky race, Hobgoblins make fine scouts."

These hobgoblins travel and fight on wolfback, having long ago formed a beneficial relationship with the large and intelligent wolves of the region. They are ruled over by Khans, Hobgoblins sufficiently paranoid and treacherous to rise to the top of a tribe and survive enough betrayals to solidify power, at least for now. All Khans wear crowns of iron and in theory serve the Great Hobgobla Khan, ruler of all their kind and the only chieftain permitted to wear a crown of gold.

This tribe, known as the Sneaky Gits, lives to the east of Zharr-Naggrund. The warriors of this tribe fight in battle with two long curving knives treated with all manner of poisons and ideally suited to their back stabbing methods. The gutstabbers, as the very sneakiest assassins of this tribe are known, are duplicitous and cruel even by the standards of their fellows. Any Sneaky Git will happily place a dagger in the back of a foe or rival, but the gutstabbers are so sly that they're prone to stab a perceived enemy in the front, right in the gut! The Chaos Dwarfs use these murderous greenskins as assassins, sending them out against tribal leaders, or letting them pick their targets and kill seemingly at random just to put fear into their own slaves. They aren't nearly so skilled as the assassins of other races and far less dedicated to any cause, but are still exceptionally sneaky."

#descr "Without slaves the empire of the Chaos Dwarfs could not function; they are used extensively in every strata of society for every purpose imaginable, from ritual sacrifice, to administration, to labour, to military fodder. Yet despite this reliance on slaves, those who perform the role of buying, selling, and breaking slaves are considered to be uncivilised and are exempt from many of the social circles and rites so important to the clans. Though there is no slaver caste, slavers tend to live rather alienated lives and their offspring are unlikely to become more than slavers themselves. Typically they are not true citizens of Zharr-Naggrund, but were born and raised in one of the many lesser outposts maintained by the empire. Wearing masked helms made from the skulls of ogres and with bone fetishes in their beards, they are a greatly feared sight to any slave, for their eyes and ears are as sharp as the spines on their whips and they are always seeking to punish the slightest sign of dissent. Slavers contribute to the productivity of any fort in the province and allow the purchase of slave contracts outside forts."

Amongst Chaos Dwarfs the Warrior caste is a position of middling importance, holding status above craftsmen and civilians, but well below smiths or inductees into cult of Hashut. Castellans are members of the Warrior caste who have distinguished themselves over and over again in battle under the watchful eye of an Overlord, who in turn serves a Sorcerer Lord. The day to day running of the Sorcerer Lord's legion is left to the Castellans, who are adept in leading small forces, raiding for slaves, commanding garrisons or drilling the troops.

This is the apex to which all in the Warrior caste aspite, the zenith of all they can acheieve in life, and Overlords are utterly dedicated to their work. Without the distraction of social climbing and intrigue they are focused entirely on the art of war and the elevation of their own Sorcerer Lord to even greater power, for their fortunes are truly tied to those of their master. Each Overlord will have served many decades, perhaps even centuries as a Warrior and Castellan, almost inevitably also having spent time in the ranks of the Immortals to prove his worth. They are superb tacticians and individual combatants and are armed with some of the best available equipment, including a forge axe and magical golden scale mail.

Upon being unsealed they are given a new identity and while they can never leave the Infernal Guard or undo their dishonour entirely, they are recognised once more as having a status equivalent to that of a member of the lowest caste of Chaos Dwarf.

Even beneath their finely crafted Armor their hide is extremely tough, and they have been gifted considerable resistance to fire through their zealous worship of Hashut.

It is the Daemonsmiths who create and maintain the great daemonic machinery which delivers steam power across the capital, it is they who oversee the forging of arms and Armor, and it is they alone who can create, apply, and enchant Infernal Armor. Indeed, without them there would be no Infernal Guard at all.

Arrogant and proud, he claims to serve as prophet in the name of Hashut, but some of the Sorcerer Lords suspect he plans to ascend to the full power of a Dark God, and challenge Hashut for mastery of their race. He is protected from hostile spells by the runes forged in his younger days, and excels in the dark arts of forge-crafting and Chaos magic."

#brief "Long ago before the Time of Chaos the golden empire of the Dwarfs spread far to the East. As the tides of Chaos swallowed the world the Dwarfs assumed their Eastern brothers slain, but they were not. Abandoned by their brothers and their gods, they survived, but changed. Greed was amplified, pride became arrogance, tradition was replaced with dogma, loyalty turned to zealotry, and stoicism changed to cruelty. So were the Chaos Dwarfs birthed, a harsh people in a harsh land."

So were the Chaos Dwarfs birthed, a harsh people in a harsh land. Now with the coming of the Awakening God the forges of war have been stoked to unceasing fire, the legions of Zharr-Naggrund march forth in lockstep, and the world trembles."
#summary "Race: Chaos tainted dwarfs ruling over countless slaves from lesser races. Dwarfs no longer need to eat, but still do so. Death scales do not reduce supply.
Military: Heavy dwarf infantry with powerful weapons against massed enemies, devastating bull centaur cavalry, sneaky hobgoblin servants, and throngs of expendable slaves.
Magic: Strong Fire, Earth, and Astral with Blood and Death.
Priests: Powerful.
Mechanics: Get free outpost fortresses where they have a temple, lab, and positive dominion."

The Razordon then springs forth to crush its prey in its powerful jaws and swallow great hunks of it down whole. Skink handlers have learned to harness these aggressive but stealthy creatures in war, where their barbs are as deadly as crossbow bolts and their thick spined hide as tough as Armor. Unlike their fire breathing cousins Razordons are not truly amphibious and are poor swimmers limited to hiding in shallow swampwater."

Gigantic, Armored beasts, they are primarily vegetarians, but not adverse to dining on those creatures foolish enough to stand in their path. Their strength is legendary, enough to uproot trees and, properly directed, help erect the great stone momuments of the Lizardmen. With sharp horns, ridges of spikes and a spined tail capable of cracking rocks, Stegadons are virtually unstoppable in battle by conventional means. Skink warchiefs have large howdahs strapped to these beasts and a crew of hunters fire upon the enemy with bows and javelins as the Stegadon charges forward."

Sotek is not an Old One, though the serpent god of blood and vengeance was foretold by the Slann, who have yet to even acknowledge the Cult. Sotek is cruel and violent and his warriors are aggressive to the point of berserk rage. At first the followers of Sotek were all red crested Skinks and Tehenhauin, their prophet, the only true priest or leader amongst them. But since the expulsion of the Skaven, priests and even Saurus spawnings have born the blood red marking of Sotek. All of Sotek's chosen are immune to poison."

Within days of first tasting the blood of Sotek's foes, they grow larger and stronger than their brethren and begin to goad them into even greater states of frenzy, leading constant raids and assaults. Other Saurus of Sotek bear bloodstain like markings on their back and crest, but the Bloodscales are almost entirely the colour of gore. In battle they unleash a terrible scream like the hissing of a thousand angry serpents and their mere presence can cause widespread panic. Bloodscales are avatars of Sotek's wrath whose axes are terrifyingly effective against the chosen of false gods. Legend has it that to even try to harm a Bloodscale might bring the vengeful attention of the serpent god. All of Sotek's chosen are immune to poison."

In battle their eyes blaze like the sun, too bright and intense for lesser foes to meet and with the power to scour undead from their sight. Energetic and emotional in a way few Lizardmen can understand, Sunscales live for the excitement of battle and fight at a frantic pace with considerable skill. They are by far the most common of the Sacred Scales."

It is a practice which deeply concerns many of the Slann and their followers, but there is no doubting its effectiveness in battle."

The obsinite weapons they wield may seem crude, but they are as deadly as any forged of steel. Saurus get tougher and more ferocious as they age and by the time they gain the title Scar Veteran they have undoubtedly seen hundreds of battles. Scar Veterans are trusted to lead small forces of troops and are formidable fighters, certainly more than a match for the champions of younger races."

One in every few hundred Skinks, still a huge number in all, is spawned to serve the Slann in a more direct capacity, as a Priest. These Skinks are larger and bolder than their fellows and command a degree of respect even amongst the Saurus and Kroxigor, for they are the eyes of the Slann. Skink Priests generally attend to minor rituals and observances, though with fewer and fewer active Slann, their role in the plan of the Old Ones is increasing. Every Priest is attuned to the magical presence of the Slann and lends his power in battle through a constant communion."

Whether the Slann will ever take action against the followers of Sotek is unclear, but in the mean time their power grows. More and more spawnings show Sotek's influence and Skink Priests of Sotek are now a common sight, preaching a coming time of vengeance and making sacrifices to sate the thirst of the serpent God. Priests of Sotek are immune to poison and have dominion over snakes, indeed they have taken to using deadly poisonous jungle vipers as a means of protection. They have some skill in blood magic in addition to their native minor magic. Priests of Sotek are not naturally attuned to the communion of the Slann."

Chameleon Skinks are known to have remained in place for hours on end awaiting the perfect ambush and even in open ground they are virtually impossible to see clearly. It had been so long since the last spawning of these Skinks that they were thought to be lost forever, but in these recent years of war, they have begun to spontaneously spawn across Lizardman territory, a sign from the Old Ones that the Slann have yet to decipher.

#descr "This Slann has entered a dormant state, contemplating the will of the Old Ones, communing with Slann whose physical forms have been destroyed and renewing its own body. The more ancient a Slann, the longer it tends to spend in a dormant state. While dormant the Slann is unable to research or use magic of any sort and is entirely immobile. It is also extremely vulnerable to any form of attack, however it will recover from any afflictions sustained and will require little in the way of upkeep."

It is believed Nakai was one of the first Kroxigor to spawn in Itza; he fought in numerous battles in the Great War against Chaos, reputedly slaying a Greater Daemon in single combat. Nakai's appearance at a temple city often precedes an invasion, but no city has fallen under his watch and he is considered one of the clearest signs that the Old Ones still favour their children. Nakai carries a great Daemon slaying obsinite club of incredible power and wears a pair of twinned bracers which grant him immunity to fire and cold."

This solid obsidian shield was forged by Adohi Tegha himself in the heart of a volcano and for any other creature would be far too heavy to lift."

#spr2 "./Warhammer-Complete/Hero Tehenhauin2.tga"
#name "Prophet of Sotek"
#descr "The story of Tehenhauin is in many ways the story of Sotek. Tehenhauin began his life as a Priest in the city of Chaqua, but the arrival of the Skaven clan Pestilens changed all that. The vile ratmen somehow overcame the disease, flora and fauna of Lustria and became agents of corruption, releasing plagues which devastated the Lizardman population. Cahqua and her resident Slann were ravaged by pestilence and Tehenhauin, sensing the city was doomed, gathered the sacred golden plaques and led the survivors into the jungle. These plaques spoke of the arrival of vengeful Sotek and Tehenhauin, sacrificing thousands of captured ratmen with his serpent blade, acted as his herald. As Prophet of Sotek Tehenhauin is able to unleash wave after wave of poisonous blood red snakes in battle."

#name "He That Hunts Unseen"
#descr "One of the rare breed of Chameleon Skink, Oxyotl was already an accomplished hunter when Chaos came to the world. As the great temple city of Pahuax fell, Oxyotl fought bravely to defend his Lord the Slann Mage-Priest Pocaxalan who unleashed an incantation supposed to blast the daemons back to their realm. Unfortunately even the great Slann could not control such magical power and the centre of the city vanished in a blinding flash of light. Oxyotl awoke to find himself in the nightmarish Realm of Chaos, scant paces away from daemons feasting on the remains of his Lord. None know how Oxyotl survived his daemonic pursuers, but he found his way back to Lustria only to realise over seven thousand years had passed. His return coincided with the first spawning of Chameleon Skins in memory and with his golden blowpipe he once again began to hunt those who would disrupt the Great Plan."

#brief "The Lizardmen were created by the Old Ones, divine interstellar beings of unimaginable power. For thousands of years they have tended to the will of these beings and protected the world from Chaos."
#descr "The Lizardmen are a race of reptillian servants created by the Old Ones thousands of years ago. A servant race, they exist only to enact the Great Plan of the Old Ones. The Old Ones brought with them the First Generation of Slann and spawned four more generations to rule over the warlike Saurus, nimble Skinks and mighty Kroxigor. However a Great Catastrophe struck the world and heralded the arrival of Chaos at the poles; since that time the Old Ones have been absent. In their stead, the Lizardmen stand as guardians against Chaos and shape the world according to the Great Plan. Largely isolated in Lustria, the Lizardmen have watched and waited for a time when Chaos might be defeated and the world restored for the glorious return of their masters. Countless years of divination and consultation with the stars has revealed that time to be now and with the Awakening God the lizardmen shall set the world right once again."
#summary "Race: Cold blooded lizard people ruled by ancient Slann. Prefer heat scale +2.
Military: Skink skirmishers, savage Saurus warriors, and large jungle creatures. Sacred Temple Guard only recruitable in the presence of a Slann.
Magic: Extremely powerful Astral, Nature and Elemental magic with a separate path into Blood.
Priests: Very Powerful."

They pride themselves on their deep sense of honour and mastery of both diplomacy and war. Most High Elf Nobles are trained as a Silver Helm knight, but depending on where they hail from, their style of warfare may vary. The sharp incisive minds of Ulthuan's nobility make them the finest generals in the world, able to read the ebb and flow of battle before it unfolds. The princes of Tiranoc make battle from a swift and deadly chariot. Their weapons and armor are nigh magical heirlooms of old and their demesne provides much of their sustenance."

Their knowledge is vast and their breadth of knowledge unsurpassed. In times of strife, the mages of Hoeth join the armies, sometimes commanding entire armies themselves. With skill derived from through centuries of ardous study they deflect the spells of the enemy, while directing the destructive fires of Asuryan against the foe.

The knowledge of making these Great Weapons was lost along with the Hammer of Vaul, but the sites is still used by the Smith Priests of Vaul to make magic items of no small power. The god Vaul was chained and blinded in a eon long war with Khaine, and his priests blind themselves to prove their devotion. The Smith Priests are dedicated to their craft and their training is devoted to crafting alone. Despite their blindness, they can make items far beyond their magic skill in other areas, but their preference for elaborate forging do not make them particularly efficient."

#name "Dome of High Magic"
#descr "An arcane dome is created by high magic, covering the entire province that the mage is located in. The province will be garded by High Magic and the phoenixes drawn to this magic focus. The magic of the phoenixes will make it very hazardous for enemy mages to try to reach the province with spells. The dome will protect the province from many spells that originate from outside the warded province, as well as be a nasty trap for mages who try to penetrate the dome. The more magic gems put into the spell, the longer it will last. If the mage dies, the dome dissolves instantly. The dome is a complex weave of arcana, fire and frost."

#name "Ulthuan"
#epithet "High Elves"
#descr "The origins of the High Elves are rooted in the nativity of the World. They were once the greatest and most powerful race in the whole world and their actions shaped history. Now their people are in decline, but still they fight on resolutely. For their diminishing race to survive, the High Elves must possess an army of unequalled skill. To this end all High Elves are taught from an early age to master the sword, spear and bow. Citizen soldiers form the core of their armies, while those completely devoted to the martial arts rank among the most fearful warriors in the old world. The High Elves were the first race to study magic and remain the greatest masters in the known world. Their magic is a siphon to chaos, and their skills in controlling, shaping and, when needed, draining magic are unsurpassed."

#summary "Race: High Elves, long lived, graceful and magically skilled.
Military: Very skilled infantry, archers and cavalry, strong elite troops, all very expensive.
Magic: Very strong Astral and Fire, strong Air and Nature, some Water and Earth. No Death or Blood. Versatile smithing.
Priests: Average.
Other: Mercenaries are expensive to muster. Some units generate gold, which lowers their effective upkeep. The nation favors a coastal start."

#brief "An ancient race, the High Elves protect the world from the malign influence of Chaos. Their martial skills are rivalled only by their mastery of magic. Their excellence is a necessity, for the elves are few and the powers needed to sustain their wards are great."

The Knights Encarmine hold a great deal of political clout in the South of the Empire and are generally free to choose which campaigns they take part in, usually picking those which guarantee the most glory with the least dirty work. Knights Encarmine are unusual in that they have entirely abandoned the traditional lance and shield, instead perfecting a secret technique allowing them to wield two swords from horseback.

On the battlefield Ludwig wields the unerring Sword of Justice and carries aloft the Emperor's personal standard.

He carries two heirlooms of the Gold College; the Amulet of Sea gold, which protects against hostile magic, and the Cloak of Molten Metal, which protects against missile fire and creates illusionary copies of the mage. As Supreme Patriarch he also wields the Staff of Volans, an ancient and powerful artifact that boosts his already superb magical abilities and allows him to generate magic gems. The rulers of Nuln recently gifted Gelt a pegasus on which he soars over the battlefield, turning the tide with his spells."

Huss rose to prominence in his order and was chosen to represent the Warrior Priests in the Sigmarite Council in Altdorf. Here Huss first confronted the Arch Lectors and accused them of corruption; an act resulting in his dismissal. Since that day Huss has travelled the Empire smiting evil and inspiring the people with his great speeches. In battle Huss is surrounded by an aura of spiritual power and as he travels through the lands of the faithful he inevitably attracts crazed flagellants."

The University is closely monitored by both the Colleges of Magic and the Sigmarite Faith, for many is the bright young scholar or frustrated academic who has in the past pursued knowledge not meant for mortals and strayed into the world of dark arcana or heresy.

Gold Wizards often bear traces of their experiments in alchemy and transmutation, chemical stains and scorch marks, but also garb of fine quality and a great deal of jewellery. Gold Wizard Lords are particularly powerful members of society, as they have mastered many methods of transmutation and inevitably amassed a small personal fortune. The usage of vitriol and acid spells is restricted within the Gold order to Lords as this powerful magic is considered too dangerous for rank and file members."

The wind of Hysh is the purest amongst the Lores, though it is also the most effusive and difficult to master. Because of this, comparatively few Light Wizards ever earn the title of Wizard Lord. Those that do are true masters of the arcane who have begun to understand the nature of magic itself and can bend Light energy itself to reproduce facets of the other Lores. This focus on demanding study leaves the Lords physically weak, but at the head of a Communion of Light, they are powerful indeed."

Honouring an Order with a memorial to their fallen is an expensive act, but it will result in a group of Inner Circle Knights and perhaps even the Grandmaster of the Order pledging to serve your cause. The Order of the Sacred Scythe are one of the most feared forces in the Empire, for such is their hatred of the undead that they have been known to put entire villages to the torch should they be found guilty in tribunal. Many members of the Order are sworn to the service of Morr, God of the Dead, and each of them is well versed in the hunting of vampires. Encased in black steel and armed with sacred silver scythes they patrol the fell roads of Stirland, ever watchful for incursions from neighbouring Sylvania. The Scythes are ever watchful and though despised by the common folk, maintain a network of spies to better root out hidden foes."

Honouring an Order with a memorial to their fallen is an expensive act, but it will result in a group of Inner Circle Knights and perhaps even the Grandmaster of the Order pledging to serve your cause. The Order of the Gold Lion were founded during the crusades in Araby and are experts in desert warfare who use Estalian steeds of great endurance and favour curved Arabian blades. Though they have recently suffered some misfortunes their young Grandmaster's energy has proven infectious and they are one of the most active Orders. They are famed for their great bravery and loyalty and are known to the common people as The Lionhearts."

The Knights Griffon are the most well drilled and disciplined of all Orders, sworn to protect the Temple of Sigmar, now located in Altdorf. Founded by Magnus the Pious as a splinter of the Knights Panther, they are proud of their origin and are currently involved in a bitter rivalry with the Grand Order of the Reiksguard. The Knights Griffon are able to field some Brothers mounted on Demigryphs, whose talons can tear through armour with ease."

Honouring an Order with a memorial to their fallen is an expensive act, but it will result in a group of Inner Circle Knights and perhaps even the Grandmaster of the Order pledging to serve your cause. A recently founded Order, the Hunters of Sigmar emerged after the Storm of Chaos, pledging to track and destroy Chaos raiders left behind following the invasion. Typically operating in small groups to track Beastmen Warbands, the Hunters are expert woodsmen and can always rely on the support of the populace who appreciate such mighty warriors stooping to defend even the smallest villages. The nature of their mission means Hunters' equipment is often worn from travel and lacking the services of blacksmiths, they often discard pieces of armour damaged in skirmishes. Lances need to be replaced too often and swords become dull and rusted, so the Hunters prefer to use heavier and more reliable axes."

Upon joining their Order each brother knight takes a vow of silence and rumours abound regarding even stranger intitiation rites and dark ceremonies. Despite their reputation the Knights of Morr are stalwart defenders of humanity, particularly against users of dark magic and servants of Chaos. They are armed with blades imbued with power by the Amethyst Order which raise those they slay as undead servitors."

--------- EVENTS

--the idea here is to write an event for each knightly order which kills off their specific tribute unit and summons the knightly order.
--event one triggers when you have tribute unit X. It kills tribute unit X and summons the order X - GM and their IC. This may require two events chained together. It establishes event code Y. This event can only happen once.
--event two triggers when you have tribute unit X and event code Y. It summons a smaller number of the IC of order X.

--This requires that each nation has a tribute unit for each order they want to be able to buy.

--so it turned out that using event codes is bad and didn't work properly because you can only have one code per province at a time. Instead I tried various things, but the firstshape stuff I tried somehow screwed with event triggering and com killing.

--so in the end I basically have two events with the same trigger requirements. But because they kill the requirement, only one can trigger. It seems that it's 50/50 which triggers.

The bravest and most skilled archers in the Kingdoms would be summoned to the Temple of the Goddess, and there they would be trained in the skills of archery and granted a sacred bow, enchanted by the Goddess herself. Any arrow fired by one of these enchanted bows would arrive at its target mysteriously coated in a deadly poison. The so-called Asp Archers would normally remain as guardians of the temple, but in times of war they would march to assist a Tomb King the Goddess found worthy, where their great skills would often turn the tide of a war."

Some came forward, and the priests chose the strongest to serve as Watchers. Through powerful rituals they were gifted with the same immortality as the priests themselves - while their bodies withered and dried to husks they would never die of natural causes. The watchers stood guard over the tombs, spotting any treasure hunters far off, moving stealthily through the necropoli, and killing without warning. They wear no armor but wield halberds salvaged from treasure hunters, and miniature crossbows firing darts which paralyze their opponents. Their bodies are no longer as strong as they once were, but they remain strong and deadly opponents."

Unfortunately for those closest to the kings, their lavish lifestyles in the palaces would come to a dire end with the passing of the king - for what king would want to pass into the afterlife without his advisors? Willingly or not, they were buried alive in the royal tombs. Now they are reawakened to wield their powerful magics once more in the service of their masters."

The traditions of the priesthood stretched back for millennia even before the fall of the nation, and was an order of great learning. They foresaw the fall, and, thousands of years in advance, set about preparing for it. They developed powerful magics of self preservation, so that even as their bodies withered they would never die - a miserable but effective form of immortality. They coordinated the burial of the Tomb Kings and their legions, the nobility and their women, and performed powerful incantations to preserve them and prepare them for reawakening in paradise. And during the long darkness since the fall they have kept watch and protected the tombs. Now all their plans have come to naught, and instead they fight with the undead legions of awakened Nehekhara. The priests have considerable power over the dead, and can cast potent enchantments to protect and fortify them in battle. They also have the power to awaken the sleeping Nehekharan legions at will, although Tomb Priests are only capable of reviving a pair of soldiers per month. Nehekharan armies are often accompanied by caravans containing sarcophagi of unawakened troops, so that the Priests can awaken them given the opportunity.""

#descr "Set was a dark and mysterious animal-headed god of the ancient Nehekharan pantheon, a god of chaos and destruction. His armies of demons and undead battled endlessly against the legions of Horus. The Servants of Set are sinister creatures created in his image. Clad in rags, they move unseen through enemy territory. They are assassins and spies, and can use their potent mental powers to sow the seeds of unrest in the lands they move through and to erase the memories of any who see them. When Set was destroyed his servants were banished, but now they are called back to serve the new god of Nehekhara."

The Bone Scorpion is a huge, macabre construction built around a sarcophagus containing such an ancient priest. Although the priest is unconscious his magic permeates the scorpion, giving it false life and a degree of awareness of its own. The vast Bone Scorpions are immensely fearsome opponents on the battlefield, trampling and crushing their opponents without ever tiring."

#name "Nehekhara"
#descr "The lands of Nehekhara were once vast and fertile, and its many kingdoms were powerful for thousands of years. However, long ago a dire prophecy  was made - slowly the rivers would dry up and the land would die, and its people with it. It was foreseen that this great drought would finally be ended by the rising of a new god, when a great wave of benevolent magic would sweep the land; Nehekhara would become a paradise, and the dead, if properly preserved, would rise to live anew. So the priests of Nahakhara set about preparing. Nobles and soldiers, kings and wizards were buried carefully with powerful magics, so that they might reawaken in the distant future. Gradually the drought overtook Nehekhara, until eventually nothing moved in the vast desert. Then catastrophe struck - the fall of Ermor released dark energies that flowed  around the world; in Nehekhara the great enchantments of the priests were perverted, and its people doomed to awaken not to a new life, but to undeath."
